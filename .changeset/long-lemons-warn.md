add a new feature for collecting user profile on new user registration

You can now collect user profile information on the last step of your registration flow.

### Getting started

1. In Console: `Sign-in Experience > Collect user profile`. Add your profile fields:

   - Use built-in basics (Name, Gender, Birthdate, Address, â€¦); or
   - Create custom fields (choose type, label, validation rules, required, etc.).

2. Drag & drop to reorder fields in the list; the order reflects in the form.
3. Test by signing up a new user in the demo app; a "Tell us about yourself" step will appear with your fields.
4. Registration completes only after all required fields are filled.

Check out our [docs](https://docs.logto.io/end-user-flows/collect-user-profile) for more details.
