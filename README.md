# Logto [WIP]

🤘 Logto[^info] helps you quickly focus on everything after signing in.

**Main Features**

- An OIDC-based identity service
- All-platform user sign-in/up experience with dark mode and SDK support (SPA, iOS, and Android)
- Passwordless (SMS / Email) sign-in/up support
- Out-of-box social sign-in support (GitHub, Google, WeChat, Alipay, etc.)
- A web UI to control all above (Admin Console)
- Extendable multi-language support

Boringly, we call it "[customer identity access management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_identity_access_management)" (CIAM) or "customer identity solution."
