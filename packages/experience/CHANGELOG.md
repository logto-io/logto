### Minor Changes

- 13d04d776: feat: support multiple sign-up identifiers in sign-in experience

  ## New update

  Introduces a new optional field, `secondaryIdentifiers`, to the sign-in experience sign-up settings. This enhancement allows developers to specify multiple required user identifiers during the user sign-up process. Available options include `email`, `phone`, `username` and `emailOrPhone`.

  ### Explanation of the difference between `signUp.identifiers` and new `signUp.secondaryIdentifiers`

  The existing `signUp.identifiers` field represents the sign-up identifiers enabled for user sign-up and is an array type. In this legacy setup, if multiple identifiers are provided, users can complete the sign-up process using any one of them. The only multi-value case allowed is `[email, phone]`, which signifies that users can provide either an email or a phone number.

  To enhance flexibility and support multiple required sign-up identifiers, the existing `signUp.identifiers` field does not suffice. To maintain backward compatibility with existing data, we have introduced this new `secondaryIdentifiers` field.

  Unlike the `signUp.identifiers` field, the `signUp.secondaryIdentifiers` array follows an `AND` logic, meaning that all elements listed in this field are required during the sign-up process, in addition to the primary identifiers. This new field also accommodates the `emailOrPhone` case by defining an exclusive `emailOrPhone` value type, which indicates that either a phone number or an email address must be provided.

  In summary, while `identifiers` allows for optional selection among email and phone, `secondaryIdentifiers` enforces mandatory inclusion of all specified identifiers.

  ### Examples

  1. `username` as the primary identifier. In addition, user will be required to provide a verified `email` and `phone number` during the sign-up process.

  ```json
  {
    "identifiers": ["username"],
    "secondaryIdentifiers": [
      {
        "type": "email",
        "verify": true
      },
      {
        "type": "phone",
        "verify": true
      }
    ],
    "verify": true,
    "password": true
  }
  ```

  2. `username` as the primary identifier. In addition, user will be required to provide either a verified `email` or `phone number` during the sign-up process.

  ```json
  {
    "identifiers": ["username"],
    "secondaryIdentifiers": [
      {
        "type": "emailOrPhone",
        "verify": true
      }
    ],
    "verify": true,
    "password": true
  }
  ```

  3. `email` or `phone number` as the primary identifier. In addition, user will be required to provide a `username` during the sign-up process.

  ```json
  {
    "identifiers": ["email", "phone"],
    "secondaryIdentifiers": [
      {
        "type": "username",
        "verify": true
      }
    ],
    "verify": true,
    "password": false
  }
  ```

  ### Sign-in experience settings

  - `@logto/core`: Update the `/api/sign-in-experience` endpoint to support the new `secondaryIdentifiers` field in the sign-up settings.
  - `@logto/console`: Replace the sign-up identifier single selector with a multi-selector to support multiple sign-up identifiers. The order of the identifiers can be rearranged by dragging and dropping the items in the list. The first item in the list will be considered the primary identifier and stored in the `signUp.identifiers` field, while the rest will be stored in the `signUp.secondaryIdentifiers` field.

  ### End-user experience

  The sign-up flow is now split into two stages:

  - Primary identifiers (`signUp.identifiers`) are collected in the first-screen registration screen.
  - Secondary identifiers (`signUp.secondaryIdentifiers`) are requested in subsequent steps after the primary registration has been submitted.

  ## Other refactors

  We have fully decoupled the sign-up identifier settings from the sign-in methods. Developers can now require as many user identifiers as needed during the sign-up process without impacting the sign-in process.

  The following restrictions on sign-in and sign-up settings have been removed:

  1. Password requirement is now optional when `username` is configured as a sign-up identifier. However, users without passwords cannot sign in using username authentication.
  2. Removed the constraint requiring sign-up identifiers to be enabled as sign-in methods.
  3. Removed the requirement for password verification across all sign-in methods when password is enabled for sign-up.

## 1.11.2

### Patch Changes

- 28643c1f1: fix the email/phone identifier conflict handling logic during user registration.

  When a user attempts to register with an email/phone that already exists:

  ### Previous Behavior

  "Sign in instead" modal will be shown when:

  - The email/phone identifier has been verified through a verification code validation
  - Identifier type (email/phone) was enabled in sign-in methods

  This caused an issue when:

  - Only password authentication method was enabled in the sign-in method settings.
  - When users clicked "Sign in instead" action button, the API call will throw an sign-in method not enabled error. Which is confusing for the user.

  Expected behavior: Show the "Email/phone already exists" error modal directly. If only password authentication is enabled. User should not be able to sign in with email/phone directly.

  ### Fixed Behavior

  Shows the "Sign in instead" modal if:

  - The email/phone identifier type is enabled in the sign-in method settings and the verification code is enabled for the identifier.

  Otherwise, shows the "Email/phone already exists" error modal directly.

- bd18da4cf: properly filter WeChat connectors by platform (Web | Native) in SSR sign-in experience settings

  Previously, platform-based social connector filtering was applied during the sign-in experience settings fetch process but not in the SSR sign-in experience data. As a result, platform-specific connectors were not correctly filtered when rendering the page using SSR data.

  This update ensures that the same filtering logic is applied to SSR sign-in experience data, resolving the issue.

  Affected connectors: WeChat Web and WeChat Native.

- e11e57de8: bump dependencies for security update

## 1.11.1

### Patch Changes

- d2468683c: remove the image element's `cross-origin="anonymous"` attribute.

  Some public image resources may not have the proper cross-origin headers configured, those images may fail to load when the `cross-origin="anonymous"` attribute is present.
  Since those image elements are only used for display purposes, Logto does not need to access the image data, so the `cross-origin="anonymous"` attribute is not necessary.
  To make the image elements more compatible with public image resources, remove the `cross-origin="anonymous"` attribute from the image elements.

## 1.11.0

### Minor Changes

- f1b1d9e95: new MFA prompt policy

  You can now cutomize the MFA prompt policy in the Console.

  First, choose if you want to enable **Require MFA**:

  - **Enable**: Users will be prompted to set up MFA during the sign-in process which cannot be skipped. If the user fails to set up MFA or deletes their MFA settings, they will be locked out of their account until they set up MFA again.
  - **Disable**: Users can skip the MFA setup process during sign-up flow.

  If you choose to **Disable**, you can choose the MFA setup prompt:

  - Do not ask users to set up MFA.
  - Ask users to set up MFA during registration (skippable, one-time prompt). **The same prompt as previous policy (UserControlled)**
  - Ask users to set up MFA on their sign-in after registration (skippable, one-time prompt)

## 1.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 640425414: display support email and website info on experience error pages.

  Added support email and website info to the error pages of the experience app. E.g. when a user tries to access a page that doesn't exist, or when the social session is not found in a social callback page. This will help users to contact support easily when they encounter an error.

  You may configure the support email and website info in the sign-in experience settings page in the Logto console or through the management API.

## 1.9.0

### Minor Changes

- baa8577c4: migrate experience app using Experience API.

  Migrate experience app API requests from legacy [Interaction API](https://openapi.logto.io/group/endpoint-interaction) to the new [Experience API](https://openapi.logto.io/group/endpoint-experience), except the following endpoints:

  - `GET /api/interaction/consent`
  - `POST /api/interaction/consent`

  Those endpoints are used in the third-party application's consent page only. Remain unchanged.

- 3d3a22030: add support for additional first screen options

  This feature introduces new first screen options, allowing developers to customize the initial screen presented to users. In addition to the existing `sign_in` and `register` options, the following first screen choices are now supported:

  - `identifier:sign_in`: Only display specific identifier-based sign-in methods to users.
  - `identifier:register`: Only display specific identifier-based registration methods to users.
  - `reset_password`: Allow users to directly access the password reset page.
  - `single_sign_on`: Allow users to directly access the single sign-on (SSO) page.

  Example:

  ```javascript
  // Example usage (React project using React SDK)
  void signIn({
    redirectUri,
    firstScreen: "identifier:sign_in",
    /**
     * Optional. Specifies which sign-in methods to display on the identifier sign-in page.
     * If not specified, the default sign-in experience configuration will be used.
     * This option is effective when the `firstScreen` value is `identifier:sign_in`, `identifier:register`, or `reset_password`.
     */
    identifiers: ["email", "phone"],
  });
  ```

- 25187ef63: add support for `login_hint` parameter in sign-in method

  This feature allows you to provide a suggested identifier (email, phone, or username) for the user, improving the sign-in experience especially in scenarios where the user's identifier is known or can be inferred.

  Example:

  ```javascript
  // Example usage (React project using React SDK)
  void signIn({
    redirectUri,
    loginHint: "user@example.com",
    firstScreen: "signIn", // or 'register'
  });
  ```

- 262661677: allow link new social identity to an existing user account when registration is disabled.

  ### Previous behavior

  Sign-in with a social identity that does not have an existing user account will throw an `identity_not_exist` error. When the registration is disabled, the error message will be shown, the user will not be able to create a new account or link the social identity to an existing account via verified email or phone number.

  ### Expected behavior

  When the registration is disabled, if a related user account is found, the user should be able to link the social identity to an existing account via a verified email or phone number.

  ### Updates

  When the registration is disabled:

  - Show `identity_not_exist` error message if no related user account is found.
  - Automatically link the social identity to the existing account if a related user account is found and social automatic account linking is enabled.
  - Redirect the user to the social link account page if a related user account is found and social automatic account linking is disabled.
  - Hide the register button on the social link account page if the registration is disabled.

  When the registration is enabled:

  - Automatically register a new account with the social identity if no related user account is found.
  - Automatically link the social identity to the existing account if a related user account is found and social automatic account linking is enabled.
  - Redirect the user to the social link account page if a related user account is found and social automatic account linking is disabled.
  - Show the register new account button on the social link account page.

### Patch Changes

- 3b9714b99: set `lang` attribute for `<html>`
- ab90f43db: fix(experience): prevent errors from applying unsupported cached identifier types

  Previously, cached identifier input values were applied to all pages without type checking, potentially causing errors. Now, the type is verified before application to ensure compatibility with each page's supported types.

- fae8725a4: improve RTL language support

## 1.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 3a839f6d6: support organization logo and sign-in experience override

  Now it's able to set light and dark logos for organizations. You can upload the logos in the organization settings page.

  Also, it's possible to override the sign-in experience logo from an organization. Simply add the `organization_id` parameter to the authentication request. In most Logto SDKs, it can be done by using the `extraParams` field in the `signIn` method.

  For example, in the JavaScript SDK:

  ```ts
  import LogtoClient from "@logto/client";

  const logtoClient = new LogtoClient(/* your configuration */);

  logtoClient.signIn({
    redirectUri: "https://your-app.com/callback",
    extraParams: {
      organization_id: "<organization-id>",
    },
  });
  ```

  The value `<organization-id>` can be found in the organization settings page.

  If you could not find the `extraParams` field in the SDK you are using, please let us know.

- 62f5e5e0c: support app-level branding

  You can now set logos, favicons, and colors for your app. These settings will be used in the sign-in experience when the app initiates the authentication flow. For apps that have no branding settings, the omni sign-in experience branding will be used.

  If `organization_id` is provided in the authentication request, the app-level branding settings will be overridden by the organization's branding settings, if available.

- d203c8d2f: support experience data server-side rendering

  Logto now injects the sign-in experience settings and phrases into the `index.html` file for better first-screen performance. The experience app will still fetch the settings and phrases from the server if:

  - The server didn't inject the settings and phrases.
  - The parameters in the URL are different from server-rendered data.

- 3bf756f2b: use Vite for transpilation and bundling

  Removed ParcelJS and replaced with Vite. No breaking changes should be expected, but use a minor version bump to catch your attention.

  > [!Important]
  > The browserlist configuration for `@logto/experience` and been synced with what is stated in README.md.

- 62f5e5e0c: support dark favicon

  The favicon for the dark theme now can be set in the sign-in experience branding settings.

## 1.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 061a30a87: support agree to terms polices for Logto’s sign-in experiences

  - Automatic: Users automatically agree to terms by continuing to use the service
  - ManualRegistrationOnly: Users must agree to terms by checking a box during registration, and don't need to agree when signing in
  - Manual: Users must agree to terms by checking a box during registration or signing in

- 50c35a214: support Google One Tap

  - Conditionally load Google One Tap script if it's enabled in the config.
  - Support callback from Google One Tap.

### Patch Changes

- 136320584: allow skipping manual account linking during sign-in

  You can find this configuration in Console -> Sign-in experience -> Sign-up and sign-in -> Social sign-in -> Automatic account linking.

  When switched on, if a user signs in with a social identity that is new to the system, and there is exactly one existing account with the same identifier (e.g., email), Logto will automatically link the account with the social identity instead of prompting the user for account linking.

## 1.6.2

### Patch Changes

- cb1a38c40: show global loading icon on page relocate

  This is to address the issue where the user is redirected back to the client after a successful login, but the page is not yet fully loaded. This will show a global loading icon to indicate that the page is still loading. Preventing the user from interacting with the current sign-in page and avoid page idling confusion.

## 1.6.1

### Patch Changes

- b80934ac5: fix native social sign-in callback

  In a native environment, the social sign-in callback that posts to the native container (e.g. WKWebView in iOS) was wrong.

  This was introduced by a refactor in #5536: It updated the callback path from `/sign-in/social/:connectorId` to `/callback/social/:connectorId`. However, the function to post the message to the native container was not updated accordingly.

- bbd399e15: fix the new user from SSO register hook event not triggering bug

  ### Issue

  When a new user registers via SSO, the `PostRegister` interaction hook event is not triggered. `PostSignIn` event is mistakenly triggered instead.

  ### Root Cause

  In the SSO `post /api/interaction/sso/:connectionId/registration` API, we update the interaction event to `Register`.
  However, the hook middleware reads the event from interaction session ahead of the API logic, and the event is not updated resulting in the wrong event being triggered.

  In the current interaction API design, we should mutate the interaction event by calling the `PUT /api/interaction/event` API, instead of updating the event directly in the submit interaction APIs. (Just like the no direct mutation rule for a react state). So we can ensure the correct side effect like logs and hooks are triggered properly.

  All the other sign-in methods are using the `PUT /api/interaction/event` API to update the event. But when implementing the SSO registration API, we were trying to reduce the API requests and directly updated the event in the registration API which will submit the interaction directly.

  ### Solution

  Remove the event update logic in the SSO registration API and call the `PUT /api/interaction/event` API to update the event.
  This will ensure the correct event is triggered in the hook middleware.

  ### Action Items

  Align the current interaction API design for now.
  Need to improve the session/interaction API logic to simplify the whole process.

## 1.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 7756f50f8: support direct sign-in for sso
- 2cbc591ff: support direct sign-in

  Instead of showing a screen for the user to choose between the sign-in methods, a specific sign-in method can be initiated directly by setting the `direct_sign_in` parameter in the OIDC authentication request.

  This parameter follows the format of `direct_sign_in=<method>:<target>`, where:

  - `<method>` is the sign-in method to trigger. Currently the only supported value is `social`.
  - `<target>` is the target value for the sign-in method. If the method is `social`, the value is the social connector's `target`.

  When a valid `direct_sign_in` parameter is set, the first screen will be skipped and the specified sign-in method will be triggered immediately upon entering the sign-in experience. If the parameter is invalid, the default behavior of showing the first screen will be used.

### Patch Changes

- 5a7204571: skip non-object messages in the native environment

  In the `WKWebView` of new iOS versions, some script will constantly post messages to the
  window object with increasing numbers as the message content ("1", "2", "3", ...).

  Ideally, we should check the source of the message with Logto-specific identifier in the
  `event.data`; however, this change will result a breaking change for the existing
  native SDK implementations. Add the `isObject` check to prevent the crazy messages while
  keeping the backward compatibility.

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 32df9acde: update user consent page to support the new third-party application feature

  - Only show the user consent page if current application is a third-party application, otherwise auto-consent the requested scopes.
  - Add the new fetching API to get the user consent context. Including the application detail, authenticated user info, all the requested scopes and user organizations info (if requested scopes include the organization scope).
  - Add the new user consent interaction API and authorize button. User have to manually authorize the requested scopes for the third-party application before continue the authentication flow.

- 31e60811d: use Node 20 LTS for engine requirement.

  Note: We mark it as minor because Logto is shipping with Docker image and it's not a breaking change for users.

### Patch Changes

- 9089dbf84: upgrade TypeScript to 5.3.3

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 9a7b19e49: Implement the new single sign-on (SSO) interaction flow

  - `/single-sign-on/email` - The SSO email form page for user to enter their email address.
  - `/single-sign-on/connectors` - The SSO connectors page for user to select the enabled SSO connector they want to use.
  - Implement the email identifier guard on all the sign-in and registration identifier forms. If the email address is enabled with SSO, redirect user to the SSO flow.

### Patch Changes

- 9421375d7: Bump libphonenumber-js to v1.10.51 to support China 19 started phone numbers. Thanks to @agileago

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 6727f629d: feature: introduce multi-factor authentication

  We're excited to announce that Logto now supports multi-factor authentication (MFA) for your sign-in experience. Navigate to the "Multi-factor auth" tab to configure how you want to secure your users' accounts.

  In this release, we introduce the following MFA methods:

  - Authenticator app OTP: users can add any authenticator app that supports the TOTP standard, such as Google Authenticator, Duo, etc.
  - WebAuthn (Passkey): users can use the standard WebAuthn protocol to register a hardware security key, such as biometric keys, Yubikey, etc.
  - Backup codes：users can generate a set of backup codes to use when they don't have access to other MFA methods.

  For a smooth transition, we also support to configure the MFA policy to require MFA for sign-in experience, or to allow users to opt-in to MFA.

## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 6f5a0acad: fix a bug that prevents user from customizing i18n translations in Sign-in Experience config

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- e8b0b1d02: feature: password policy

  ### Summary

  This feature enables custom password policy for users. Now it is possible to guard with the following rules when a user is creating a new password:

  - Minimum length (default: `8`)
  - Minimum character types (default: `1`)
  - If the password has been pwned (default: `true`)
  - If the password is exactly the same as or made up of the restricted phrases:
    - Repetitive or sequential characters (default: `true`)
    - User information (default: `true`)
    - Custom words (default: `[]`)

  If you are an existing Logto Cloud user or upgrading from a previous version, to ensure a smooth experience, we'll keep the original policy as much as possible:

  > The original password policy requires a minimum length of 8 and at least 2 character types (letters, numbers, and symbols).

  Note in the new policy implementation, it is not possible to combine lower and upper case letters into one character type. So the original password policy will be translated into the following:

  - Minimum length: `8`
  - Minimum character types: `2`
  - Pwned: `false`
  - Repetitive or sequential characters: `false`
  - User information: `false`
  - Custom words: `[]`

  If you want to change the policy, you can do it:

  - Logto Console -> Sign-in experience -> Password policy.
  - Update `passwordPolicy` property in the sign-in experience via Management API.

  ### Side effects

  - All new users will be affected by the new policy immediately.
  - Existing users will not be affected by the new policy until they change their password.
  - We removed password restrictions when adding or updating a user via Management API.

    - logto

- 343b1090f: Allow admin tenant admin to create tenants without limitation
- 343b1090f: ## Add iframe modal for mobile platform

  Implement a full screen iframe modal on the mobile platform. As for most of the webview containers, opening a new tab is not allowed. So we need to implement a full screen iframe modal to show the external link page on the mobile platform.

- 343b1090f: New feature: User account settings page

  - We have removed the previous settings page and moved it to the account settings page. You can access to the new settings menu by clicking the user avatar in the top right corner.
  - You can directly change the language or theme from the popover menu, and explore more account settings by clicking the "Profile" menu item.
  - You can update your avatar, name and username in the profile page, and also changing your password.
  - [Cloud] Cloud users can also link their email address and social accounts (Google and GitHub at first launch).

- c12717412: ## Smart Identifier Input designed to streamline your sign-in experience

  - Smart Contact Input
  - Smart Identifier Input
  - Intelligent Identifier Input Field

  Content:
  We have integrated the traditional input fields for username, phone number, and email into a single intelligent input box. This advanced input box automatically identifies the type of characters you’re entering, such as an @ sign or consecutive numbers, and provides relevant error feedback. By streamlining the sign-in process, users no longer need to waste time figuring out which button to click to switch their desired login method. This reduces the risk of errors and ensures a smoother sign-in experience.

- 343b1090f: Implement a country code selector dropdown component with search box. Users may able to quick search for a country code by typing in the search box.
- 343b1090f: remove the branding style config and make the logo URL config optional
- c12717412: **Customize CSS for Sign-in Experience**

  We have put a lot of effort into improving the user sign-in experience and have provided a brand color option for the UI. However, we know that fine-tuning UI requirements can be unpredictable. While Logto is still exploring the best options for customization, we want to provide a programmatic method to unblock your development.

  You can now use the Management API `PATCH /api/sign-in-exp` with body `{ "customCss": "arbitrary string" }` to set customized CSS for the sign-in experience. You should see the value of `customCss` attached after `<title>` of the page. If the style has a higher priority, it should be able to override.

  > **Note**
  >
  > Since Logto uses CSS Modules, you may see a hash value in the `class` property of DOM elements (e.g. a `<div>` with `vUugRG_container`). To override these, you can use the `$=` CSS selector to match elements that end with a specified value. In this case, it should be `div[class$=container]`.

- 343b1090f: Add custom CSS code editor so that users can apply advanced UI customization.

- 2168936b9: **Sign-in Experience v2**

  We are thrilled to announce the release of the newest version of the Sign-in Experience, which includes more ways to sign-in and sign-up, as well as a framework that is easier to understand and more flexible to configure in the Admin Console.

  When compared to Sign-in Experience v1, this version’s capability was expanded so that it could support a greater variety of flexible use cases. For example, now users can sign up with email verification code and sign in with email and password.

  We hope that this will be able to assist developers in delivering a successful sign-in flow, which will also be appreciated by the end users.

- 343b1090f: ### Add custom content sign-in-experience settings to allow insert custom static html content to the logto sign-in pages

  - feat: combine with the custom css, give the user the ability to further customize the sign-in pages

- fdb2bb48e: **Streamlining the social sign-up flow**

  - detect trusted email (or phone number) from the social account
    - email (or phone number) has been registered: automatically connecting the social identity to the existing user account with a single click
    - email (or phone number) not registered: automatically sync up the user profile with the social provided email (or phone) if and only if marked as a required user profile.

- f41fd3f05: Replace the `sms` naming convention using `phone` cross logto codebase. Including Sign-in Experience types, API paths, API payload and internal variable names.

### Patch Changes

- 51f527b0c: bug fixes

  - core: fix 500 error when enabling app admin access in console
  - ui: handle required profile errors on social binding flow

- 343b1090f: ## Implement a lite version of set password form.

  To simplify the effort when user set new password, we implement a lite version of set password form.

  The lite version of set password form only contains only one field password. It will be used if and only if the forgot-password feature is enabled (password can be reset either by email and phone).

  If you do not have any email or sms service enabled, we still use the old version of set password form which contains two fields: password and confirm password.

- 38970fb88: Fix a Sign-in experience bug that may block some users to sign in.
- 02cc9abd8: Fix a bug to show forgot password when only SMS connector is configured
- 343b1090f: - Add Power By Logto Signature to the main-flow pages

### Minor Changes

- c12717412: ## Smart Identifier Input designed to streamline your sign-in experience

  - Smart Contact Input
  - Smart Identifier Input
  - Intelligent Identifier Input Field

  Content:
  We have integrated the traditional input fields for username, phone number, and email into a single intelligent input box. This advanced input box automatically identifies the type of characters you’re entering, such as an @ sign or consecutive numbers, and provides relevant error feedback. By streamlining the sign-in process, users no longer need to waste time figuring out which button to click to switch their desired login method. This reduces the risk of errors and ensures a smoother sign-in experience.

- c12717412: **Customize CSS for Sign-in Experience**

  We have put a lot of effort into improving the user sign-in experience and have provided a brand color option for the UI. However, we know that fine-tuning UI requirements can be unpredictable. While Logto is still exploring the best options for customization, we want to provide a programmatic method to unblock your development.

  You can now use the Management API `PATCH /api/sign-in-exp` with body `{ "customCss": "arbitrary string" }` to set customized CSS for the sign-in experience. You should see the value of `customCss` attached after `<title>` of the page. If the style has a higher priority, it should be able to override.

  > **Note**
  >
  > Since Logto uses CSS Modules, you may see a hash value in the `class` property of DOM elements (e.g. a `<div>` with `vUugRG_container`). To override these, you can use the `$=` CSS selector to match elements that end with a specified value. In this case, it should be `div[class$=container]`.
