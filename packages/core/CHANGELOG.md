### Minor Changes

- 13d04d776: feat: support multiple sign-up identifiers in sign-in experience

  ## New update

  Introduces a new optional field, `secondaryIdentifiers`, to the sign-in experience sign-up settings. This enhancement allows developers to specify multiple required user identifiers during the user sign-up process. Available options include `email`, `phone`, `username` and `emailOrPhone`.

  ### Explanation of the difference between `signUp.identifiers` and new `signUp.secondaryIdentifiers`

  The existing `signUp.identifiers` field represents the sign-up identifiers enabled for user sign-up and is an array type. In this legacy setup, if multiple identifiers are provided, users can complete the sign-up process using any one of them. The only multi-value case allowed is `[email, phone]`, which signifies that users can provide either an email or a phone number.

  To enhance flexibility and support multiple required sign-up identifiers, the existing `signUp.identifiers` field does not suffice. To maintain backward compatibility with existing data, we have introduced this new `secondaryIdentifiers` field.

  Unlike the `signUp.identifiers` field, the `signUp.secondaryIdentifiers` array follows an `AND` logic, meaning that all elements listed in this field are required during the sign-up process, in addition to the primary identifiers. This new field also accommodates the `emailOrPhone` case by defining an exclusive `emailOrPhone` value type, which indicates that either a phone number or an email address must be provided.

  In summary, while `identifiers` allows for optional selection among email and phone, `secondaryIdentifiers` enforces mandatory inclusion of all specified identifiers.

  ### Examples

  1. `username` as the primary identifier. In addition, user will be required to provide a verified `email` and `phone number` during the sign-up process.

  ```json
  {
    "identifiers": ["username"],
    "secondaryIdentifiers": [
      {
        "type": "email",
        "verify": true
      },
      {
        "type": "phone",
        "verify": true
      }
    ],
    "verify": true,
    "password": true
  }
  ```

  2. `username` as the primary identifier. In addition, user will be required to provide either a verified `email` or `phone number` during the sign-up process.

  ```json
  {
    "identifiers": ["username"],
    "secondaryIdentifiers": [
      {
        "type": "emailOrPhone",
        "verify": true
      }
    ],
    "verify": true,
    "password": true
  }
  ```

  3. `email` or `phone number` as the primary identifier. In addition, user will be required to provide a `username` during the sign-up process.

  ```json
  {
    "identifiers": ["email", "phone"],
    "secondaryIdentifiers": [
      {
        "type": "username",
        "verify": true
      }
    ],
    "verify": true,
    "password": false
  }
  ```

  ### Sign-in experience settings

  - `@logto/core`: Update the `/api/sign-in-experience` endpoint to support the new `secondaryIdentifiers` field in the sign-up settings.
  - `@logto/console`: Replace the sign-up identifier single selector with a multi-selector to support multiple sign-up identifiers. The order of the identifiers can be rearranged by dragging and dropping the items in the list. The first item in the list will be considered the primary identifier and stored in the `signUp.identifiers` field, while the rest will be stored in the `signUp.secondaryIdentifiers` field.

  ### End-user experience

  The sign-up flow is now split into two stages:

  - Primary identifiers (`signUp.identifiers`) are collected in the first-screen registration screen.
  - Secondary identifiers (`signUp.secondaryIdentifiers`) are requested in subsequent steps after the primary registration has been submitted.

  ## Other refactors

  We have fully decoupled the sign-up identifier settings from the sign-in methods. Developers can now require as many user identifiers as needed during the sign-up process without impacting the sign-in process.

  The following restrictions on sign-in and sign-up settings have been removed:

  1. Password requirement is now optional when `username` is configured as a sign-up identifier. However, users without passwords cannot sign in using username authentication.
  2. Removed the constraint requiring sign-up identifiers to be enabled as sign-in methods.
  3. Removed the requirement for password verification across all sign-in methods when password is enabled for sign-up.

- 3594e1316: refactor: switch to `@logto/experience` package with latest [Experience API](https://openapi.logto.io/group/endpoint-experience)

  In this release, we have transitioned the user sign-in experience from the legacy `@logto/experience-legacy` package to the latest `@logto/experience` package. This change fully adopts our new [Experience API](https://openapi.logto.io/group/endpoint-experience), enhancing the underlying architecture while maintaining the same user experience.

  - Package update: The user sign-in experience now utilizes the `@logto/experience` package by default.
    API Transition: The new package leverages our latest [Experience API](https://openapi.logto.io/group/endpoint-experience).
  - No feature changes: Users will notice no changes in functionality or experience compared to the previous implementation.

### Patch Changes

- 7b342f7ef: remove `client_id` from OIDC SSO connector's token request body for better compatibility

  This updates addresses an issue with client authentication methods in the token request process. Previously, the `client_id` was included in the request body while also using the authentication header for client credentials authentication.

  This dual method of client authentication can lead to errors with certain OIDC providers, such as Okta, which only support one authentication method at a time.

  ### Key changes

  Removal of `client_id` from request body: The `client_id` parameter has been removed from the token request body. According to the [OAuth 2.0 specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.3), `client_id` in the body is required only for public clients.

- eb802f4c4: remove multiple sign-in experience settings restrictions

  For better customization flexibility, we have removed following restrictions in the sign-in experience "sign-in and sign-up" settings:

  1. The `password` field in sign-up settings is no longer required when username is set as the sign-up identifier. Developers may request a username without requiring a password during the sign-up process.

  Note: If username is the only sign-up identifier, users without a password will not be able to sign in. Developers or administrators should carefully configure the sign-up and sign-in settings to ensure a smooth user experience.

  Users can still set password via [account API](https://docs.logto.io/end-user-flows/account-settings/by-account-api) after sign-up.

  2. The requirement that all sign-up identifiers must also be enabled as sign-in identifiers has been removed.

## 1.25.0

### Minor Changes

- 1c7bdf9ba: add legacy password type supporting custom hasing function, credits @fre2d0m

  You can now set the type of `password_encryption_method` to `legacy`, and store info with a JSON string format (containing a hash algorithm, arguments, and an encrypted password) in the `password_encrypted` field. By doing this, you can use any hash algorithm supported by Node.js, this is useful when migrating from other password hash algorithms, especially for the ones that include salt.

  The format of the JSON string is as follows:

  ```json
  ["hash_algorithm", ["argument1", "argument2", ...], "expected_hashed_value"]
  ```

  And you can use `@` as the input password in the arguments.

  For example, if you are using SHA256 with a salt, you can store the password in the following format:

  ```json
  [
    "sha256",
    ["salt123", "@"],
    "c465f66c6ac481a7a17e9ed5b4e2e7e7288d892f12bf1c95c140901e9a70436e"
  ]
  ```

  Then when the user uses the password (`password123`), the `legacyVerify` function will use the `sha256` algorithm with the `salt123` and the input password to verify the password.

  In this case, `salt123` is the first argument, `@` is the input password, then the following code will be executed:

  ```ts
  const hash = crypto.createHash("sha256");
  hash.update("salt123" + "password123");
  const expectedHashedValue = hash.digest("hex");
  ```

- 03ea1f96c: feat: custom email templates in multiple languages via Management API

  ## Details

  Introduce localized email template customization capabilities. This update allows administrators to create and manage multiple email templates for different languages and template types (e.g., SignIn, ForgotPassword) via the management API.

  Email connectors now support automatic template selection based on the user's preferred language. If a template is not available in the user's preferred language, the default template will be used.

  - For client-side API requests, like experience API and user account API, the user's preferred language is determined by the `Accept-Language` header.
  - For server-side API requests, like organization invitation API, email language preference can be set by passing extra `locale` parameter in the `messagePayload`.
  - The email template selection logic is based on the following priority order:
    1. Find the template that matches the user's preferred language detected from the request.
    2. Find the template that matches the default language set in the sign-in experience settings.
    3. Use the default template set in the email connector settings.

  ### Management API

  - `PUT /email-templates`: Bulk create or update email templates.
  - `GET /email-templates`: List all email templates with filter by language and type support.
  - `DELETE /email-templates`: Bulk delete email templates by language and type.
  - `GET /email-templates/{id}`: Get a specific email template by ID.
  - `DELETE /email-templates/{id}`: Delete a specific email template by ID.
  - `PATCH /email-templates/{id}/details`: Update email template details by ID.

  ### Supported email connectors

  - `@logto/connector-aliyun-dm`
  - `@logto/connector-aws-ses`
  - `@logto/connector-mailgun`
  - `@logto/connector-sendgrid-email`
  - `@logto/connector-smtp`

  ### Unsupported email connectors

  The following email connectors have their templates managed at the provider side and do not support reading templates from Logto.
  The user's preferred language will be passed to the provider as the `locale` parameter in the email sending request payload. For i18n support, administrators must manage the template selection logic at the provider side.

  - `@logto/connector-postmark`
  - `@logto/connector-http-email`

- 03ea1f96c: pass additional context variables to email templates

  Enhanced email template customization by introducing additional context variables that developers can utilize in message templates. These new variables provide deeper contextual information about the authentication workflow, enabling more personalized and scenario-specific email content.

  - user: `UserInfo` - Contains basic user profile data (name, primaryEmail, etc.) for personalization
  - application: `ApplicationInfo` - Contains basic application-specific data (name, logo, etc.) for personalization
  - organization: `OrganizationInfo` - Contains basic organization-specific data (name, logo, etc.) for personalization
  - inviter: `UserInfo` - Contains basic inviter profile data (name, primaryEmail, etc.) for personalization

- c87424025: feat: support role names alongside role IDs in organization user role assignment/replacement with merge capability

  This update enhances organization user role management APIs to support role assignment by both names and IDs, improving integration flexibility.

  ### Updates

  - Added `organizationRoleNames` parameter to:
    - POST `/api/organizations/{id}/users/{userId}/roles` (assign roles)
    - PUT `/api/organizations/{id}/users/{userId}/roles` (replace roles)
  - Make both `organizationRoleNames` and `organizationRoleIds` optional in the above APIs
    - If both are not provided, or empty, an invalid data error will be thrown
  - Merge logic when both parameters are provided:
    - Combines roles from `organizationRoleNames` and `organizationRoleIds`
    - Automatically deduplicates entries
    - Validates all names/IDs exist before applying changes
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing integrations using role IDs

### Patch Changes

- bca4177c6: add `AuthnStatement` to SAML app assertion response
- 20b61e05e: refactor: adjust TOTP secret length to 20 bytes

  Update the TOTP secret generation to use 20 bytes (160 bits), following the recommendation in RFC 6238 (TOTP) and RFC 4226 (HOTP).

  This aligns with the standard secret length used by most 2FA applications and provides better security while maintaining compatibility with existing TOTP validators.

  Reference:

  - RFC 6238 (TOTP) Section 5.1: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6238#section-5.1
  - RFC 4226 (HOTP) Section 4, Requirement 6: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4226#section-4

- f15602f19: fix: incorrect pagination behavior in organization role scopes APIs

  - Fix `/api/organization-roles/{id}/scopes` and `/api/organization-roles/{id}/resource-scopes` endpoints to:
    - Return all scopes when no pagination parameters are provided
    - Support optional pagination when query parameters are present
  - Fix Console to properly display all organization role scopes on the organization template page

### Patch Changes

- e7accfdab: prevent i18n context contamination by using request-scoped instances

  This bug fix resolves a concurrency issue in i18n handling by moving from a global i18next instance to request-scoped instances.

  ### Problem

  When handling concurrent requests:

  - The shared global `i18next` instance's language was being modified via `changeLanguage()` calls.
  - This could lead to race conditions where requests might receive translations in unexpected languages.
  - Particularly problematic in multi-tenant environments with different language requirements.

  ### Solution

  - Updated `koaI18next` middleware to create a cloned i18next instance for each request.
  - Attach the request-scoped instance to Koa context (`ctx.i18n`) All subsequent middleware and handlers should now use `ctx.i18n` instead of the global `i18next` instance.
  - Maintains the global instance for initialization while preventing cross-request contamination

- a5990ec57: fixes an incorrect condition check in the verification code flow where `isNewIdentifier` was using inverted logic for email and phone comparisons.

  ### Changes

  - Corrected `isNewIdentifier` boolean logic to use `identifier.value !== user.primaryEmail` for email checks
  - Fixed phone number comparison to properly use `identifier.value !== user.primaryPhone`

  ### Impact

  This fixes a regression where:

  - Verification codes for existing emails/phones were incorrectly using the`BindNewIdentifier` template
  - New identifiers were mistakenly getting the `UserPermissionValidation` template
  - Affected both email and phone verification flows

### Minor Changes

- f1b1d9e95: new MFA prompt policy

  You can now cutomize the MFA prompt policy in the Console.

  First, choose if you want to enable **Require MFA**:

  - **Enable**: Users will be prompted to set up MFA during the sign-in process which cannot be skipped. If the user fails to set up MFA or deletes their MFA settings, they will be locked out of their account until they set up MFA again.
  - **Disable**: Users can skip the MFA setup process during sign-up flow.

  If you choose to **Disable**, you can choose the MFA setup prompt:

  - Do not ask users to set up MFA.
  - Ask users to set up MFA during registration (skippable, one-time prompt). **The same prompt as previous policy (UserControlled)**
  - Ask users to set up MFA on their sign-in after registration (skippable, one-time prompt)

### Patch Changes

- 239b81e31: loose redirect uri restrictions

  Logto has been following the industry best practices for OAuth2.0 and OIDC from the start. However, in the real world, there are things we cannot control, like third-party services or operation systems like Windows.

  This update relaxes restrictions on redirect URIs to allow the following:

  1. A mix of native and HTTP(S) redirect URIs. For example, a native app can now use a redirect URI like `https://example.com`.
  2. Native schemes without a period (`.`). For example, `myapp://callback` is now allowed.

  When such URIs are configured, Logto Console will display a prominent warning. This change is backward-compatible and will not affect existing applications.

  We hope this change will make it easier for you to integrate Logto with your applications.

### Minor Changes

- 640425414: add `trustUnverifiedEmail` setting for the Microsoft EntraID OIDC SSO connector

  Since we launched the **EntraID OIDC SSO connector** we have received several feedbacks that their customer's email address can not be populated to Logto's user profile when signing up through the EntraID OIDC SSO connector.
  This is because Logto only syncs verified email addresses, meaning the `email_verified` claim must be `true` in the user info response from the OIDC provider.

  However, based on Microsoft's documentation, since the user's email address in manually managed by the organization, they are not verified guaranteed. This means that the `email_verified` claim will not be included in their user info response.

  To address this issue, we have added a new `trustUnverifiedEmail` exclusively for the Microsoft EntraID OIDC SSO connector. When this setting is enabled, Logto will trust the email address provided by the Microsoft EntraID OIDC SSO connector even if the `email_verified` claim is not included in the user info response. This will allow users to sign up and log in to Logto using their email address without any issues. Please note this may introduce a security risk as the email address is not verified by the OIDC provider. You should only enable this setting if you trust the email address provided by the Microsoft EntraID OIDC SSO connector.

  You can configure this setting in the **EntraID OIDC SSO connector** settings page in the Logto console or through the management API.

- 640425414: display support email and website info on experience error pages.

  Added support email and website info to the error pages of the experience app. E.g. when a user tries to access a page that doesn't exist, or when the social session is not found in a social callback page. This will help users to contact support easily when they encounter an error.

  You may configure the support email and website info in the sign-in experience settings page in the Logto console or through the management API.

- 7ebef18e3: add account api

  Introduce the new Account API, designed to give end users direct API access without needing to go through the Management API, here is the highlights:

  1. Direct access: The Account API empowers end users to directly access and manage their own account profile without requiring the relay of Management API.
  2. User profile and identities management: Users can fully manage their profiles and security settings, including the ability to update identity information like email, phone, and password, as well as manage social connections. MFA and SSO support are coming soon.
  3. Global access control: Admin has full, global control over access settings, can customize each fields.
  4. Seamless authorization: Authorizing is easier than ever! Simply use `client.getAccessToken()` to obtain an opaque access token for OP (Logto), and attach it to the Authorization header as `Bearer <access_token>`.

  ## Get started

  > ![Note]
  > Go to the [Logto Docs](https://bump.sh/logto/doc/logto-user-api) to find full API reference.

  1. Use `/api/account-center` endpoint to enable the feature, for security reason, it is disabled by default. And set fields permission for each field.
  2. Use `client.getAccessToken()` to get the access token.
  3. Attach the access token to the Authorization header of your request, and start interacting with the Account API directly from the frontend.
  4. You may need to setup `logto-verification-id` header as an additional verification for some requests related to identity verification.

  ## What you can do with Account API

  1. Get user account profile
  2. Update basic information including name, avatar, username and other profile information
  3. Update password
  4. Update primary email
  5. Update primary phone
  6. Manage social identities

- 640425414: add unknown session redirect url in the sign-in experience settings

  In certain cases, Logto may be unable to properly identify a user’s authentication session when they land on the sign-in page. This can happen if the session has expired, if the user bookmarks the sign-in URL for future access, or if they directly share the sign-in link. By default, an "unknown session" 404 error is displayed.

  To improve user experience, we have added a new `unknownSessionRedirectUrl` field in the sign-in experience settings.You can configure this field to redirect users to a custom URL when an unknown session is detected. This will help users to easily navigate to your client application or website and reinitiate the authentication process automatically.

- bc2a0ac03: add environment variable to override default database connection timeout

  By default, out database connection timeout is set to 5 seconds, which might not be enough for some network conditions. This change allows users to override the default value by setting the `DATABASE_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT` environment variable.

- 3c993d59c: fix an issue that prevent mp4 video from playing in custom sign-in pages on Safari browser

  Safari browser uses range request to fetch video data, but it was not supported by the `koa-serve-custom-ui-assets` middleware in core. This prevents our users who want to build custom sign-in pages with video background. In order to fix this, we need to partially read the video file stream based on the `range` request header, and set proper response headers and status code (206).

## 1.20.0

### Minor Changes

- e0326c96c: Add personal access token (PAT)

  Personal access tokens (PATs) provide a secure way for users to grant access tokens without using their credentials and interactive sign-in.

  You can create a PAT by going to the user's detail page in Console or using the Management API `POST /users/:userId/personal-access-tokens`.

  To use a PAT, call the token exchange endpoint `POST /oidc/token` with the following parameters:

  1. `grant_type`: REQUIRED. The value of this parameter must be `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange` indicates that a token exchange is being performed.
  2. `resource`: OPTIONAL. The resource indicator, the same as other token requests.
  3. `scope`: OPTIONAL. The requested scopes, the same as other token requests.
  4. `subject_token`: REQUIRED. The user's PAT.
  5. `subject_token_type`: REQUIRED. The type of the security token provided in the `subject_token` parameter. The value of this parameter must be `urn:logto:token-type:personal_access_token`.
  6. `client_id`: REQUIRED. The client identifier of the client application that is making the request, the returned access token will contain this client_id claim.

  And the response will be a JSON object with the following properties:

  1. `access_token`: REQUIRED. The access token of the user, which is the same as other token requests like `authorization_code` or `refresh_token`.
  2. `issued_token_type`: REQUIRED. The type of the issued token. The value of this parameter must be `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token`.
  3. `token_type`: REQUIRED. The type of the token. The value of this parameter must be `Bearer`.
  4. `expires_in`: REQUIRED. The lifetime in seconds of the access token.
  5. `scope`: OPTIONAL. The scopes of the access token.

- 3d3a22030: add support for additional first screen options

  This feature introduces new first screen options, allowing developers to customize the initial screen presented to users. In addition to the existing `sign_in` and `register` options, the following first screen choices are now supported:

  - `identifier:sign_in`: Only display specific identifier-based sign-in methods to users.
  - `identifier:register`: Only display specific identifier-based registration methods to users.
  - `reset_password`: Allow users to directly access the password reset page.
  - `single_sign_on`: Allow users to directly access the single sign-on (SSO) page.

  Example:

  ```javascript
  // Example usage (React project using React SDK)
  void signIn({
    redirectUri,
    firstScreen: "identifier:sign_in",
    /**
     * Optional. Specifies which sign-in methods to display on the identifier sign-in page.
     * If not specified, the default sign-in experience configuration will be used.
     * This option is effective when the `firstScreen` value is `identifier:sign_in`, `identifier:register`, or `reset_password`.
     */
    identifiers: ["email", "phone"],
  });
  ```

- 25187ef63: add support for `login_hint` parameter in sign-in method

  This feature allows you to provide a suggested identifier (email, phone, or username) for the user, improving the sign-in experience especially in scenarios where the user's identifier is known or can be inferred.

  Example:

  ```javascript
  // Example usage (React project using React SDK)
  void signIn({
    redirectUri,
    loginHint: "user@example.com",
    firstScreen: "signIn", // or 'register'
  });
  ```

- b837efead: add access deny method to the custom token claims script

  Introduce a new `api` parameter to the custom token claims script. This parameter is used to provide more access control context over the token exchange process.
  Use `api.denyAccess()` to reject the token exchange request. Use this method to implement your own access control logics.

  ```javascript
  const getCustomJwtClaims: async ({ api }) => {
    // Reject the token request, with a custom error message
    return api.denyAccess('Access denied');
  }
  ```

- cc346b4e0: add password policy checking api

  Add `POST /api/sign-in-exp/default/check-password` API to check if the password meets the password policy configured in the default sign-in experience. A user ID is required for this API if rejects user info is enabled in the password policy.

  Here's a non-normative example of the request and response:

  ```http
  POST /api/sign-in-exp/default/check-password
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
    "password": "123",
    "userId": "some-user-id"
  }
  ```

  ```http
  400 Bad Request
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
    "result": false,
    "issues": [
      { "code": "password_rejected.too_short" },
      { "code": "password_rejected.character_types" },
      { "code": "password_rejected.restricted.sequence" }
    ]
  }
  ```

### Patch Changes

- a748fc85b: fix: add `hasPassword` field to user API response
- fae8725a4: improve RTL language support
- 6951e3157: introduce new `parse_error` query parameter flag. The value of `parse_error` can only be `false`.

  By default, Logto returns the parsed error code and error description in all the `RequestError` error responses. This is to ensure the error responses are consistent and easy to understand.

  However, when integrating Logto with Google OAuth, the error response body containing `code` will be rejected by Google. `code` is considered as a reserved OIDC key, can't be used as the error code key in the error response body.

  To workaround this, we add a new `parse_error` query parameter flag. When parsing the OIDC error body, if the `parse_error` is set to false, only oidc error body will be returned.

  example:

  ```curl
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/oidc/token?parse_error=false"
  ```

  ```json
  {
    "error": "invalid_grant",
    "error_description": "Invalid value for parameter 'code': 'invalid_code'."
  }
  ```

- 5aab7c01b: prevent user registration and profile fulfillment with SSO-only email domains

  Emails associated with SSO-enabled domains should only be used through the SSO authentication process.

  Bug fix:

  - Creating a new user with a verification record that contains an SSO-only email domain should return a 422 `RequestError` with the error code `session.sso_required`.
  - Updating a user profile with an SSO-only email domain should return a 422 `RequestError` with the error code `session.sso_required`.

### Minor Changes

- 6477c6dee: add `custom_data` to applications

  Introduce a new property `custom_data` to the `Application` schema. This property is an arbitrary object that can be used to store custom data for an application.

  Added a new API to update the custom data of an application:

  - `PATCH /applications/:applicationId/custom-data`

- 3a839f6d6: support organization logo and sign-in experience override

  Now it's able to set light and dark logos for organizations. You can upload the logos in the organization settings page.

  Also, it's possible to override the sign-in experience logo from an organization. Simply add the `organization_id` parameter to the authentication request. In most Logto SDKs, it can be done by using the `extraParams` field in the `signIn` method.

  For example, in the JavaScript SDK:

  ```ts
  import LogtoClient from "@logto/client";

  const logtoClient = new LogtoClient(/* your configuration */);

  logtoClient.signIn({
    redirectUri: "https://your-app.com/callback",
    extraParams: {
      organization_id: "<organization-id>",
    },
  });
  ```

  The value `<organization-id>` can be found in the organization settings page.

  If you could not find the `extraParams` field in the SDK you are using, please let us know.

- 62f5e5e0c: support app-level branding

  You can now set logos, favicons, and colors for your app. These settings will be used in the sign-in experience when the app initiates the authentication flow. For apps that have no branding settings, the omni sign-in experience branding will be used.

  If `organization_id` is provided in the authentication request, the app-level branding settings will be overridden by the organization's branding settings, if available.

- 18c8fdf01: implement token exchange for user impersonation

  Added support for user impersonation via token exchange:

  1. New endpoint: `POST /subject-tokens` (Management API)
     - Request body: `{ "userId": "<user-id>" }`
     - Returns a subject token
  2. Enhanced `POST /oidc/token` endpoint (OIDC API)
     - Supports new grant type: `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange`
     - Request body:
       ```json
       {
         "grant_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange",
         "subject_token": "<subject-token>",
         "subject_token_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token",
         "client_id": "<client-id>"
       }
       ```
     - Returns an impersonated access token

  Refer to documentation for usage examples and the [Token Exchange RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8693) for more details.

- d203c8d2f: support experience data server-side rendering

  Logto now injects the sign-in experience settings and phrases into the `index.html` file for better first-screen performance. The experience app will still fetch the settings and phrases from the server if:

  - The server didn't inject the settings and phrases.
  - The parameters in the URL are different from server-rendered data.

- b188bb161: support multiple app secrets with expiration

  Now secure apps (machine-to-machine, traditional web, Protected) can have multiple app secrets with expiration. This allows for secret rotation and provides an even safer experience.

  To manage your application secrets, go to Logto Console -> Applications -> Application Details -> Endpoints & Credentials.

  We've also added a set of Management APIs (`/api/applications/{id}/secrets`) for this purpose.

  > [!Important]
  > You can still use existing app secrets for client authentication, but it is recommended to delete the old ones and create new secrets with expiration for enhanced security.

- b91ec0cd6: update the jsonb field update mode from `merge` to `replace` for the `PATCH /application/:id` endpoint.
  remove the `deepPartial` statement from the `PATCH /application/:id` endpoint payload guard.

  For all the jsonb typed fields in the application entity, the update mode is now `replace` instead of `merge`. This means that when you send a `PATCH` request to update an application, the jsonb fields will be replaced with the new values instead of merging them.

  This change is to make the request behavior more strict aligned with the restful API principles for a `PATCH` request.

- d56bc2f73: add support for new password digest algorithm argon2d and argon2id

  In `POST /users`, the `passwordAlgorithm` field now accepts `Argon2d` and `Argon2id`.

  Users with those algorithms will be migrated to `Argon2i` upon succussful sign in.

- 510f681fa: use tsup for building

  We've updated some of the packages to use `tsup` for building. This will make the build process faster, and should not affect the functionality of the packages.

  Use minor version bump to catch your attention.

### Patch Changes

- 84f7e13a2: use native OpenAPI OAuth 2 security schema

  The built-in OpenAPI OAuth 2 security schema is now used instead of the custom HTTP header-based security schema. This change improves compatibility with OpenAPI tools and libraries that support OAuth 2.

- f76252e0d: fix the status code 404 error in webhook events payload

  Impact webhook events:

  - `Role.Scopes.Updated`
  - `Organizations.Membership.Updates`

  Issue: These webhook event payloads were returning a API response status code of 404 when the webhook was triggered.
  Expected: A status code of 200 should be returned, as we only trigger the webhook when the request is successful.
  Fix: All webhook event contexts should be created and inserted into the webhook pipeline after the response body and status code are properly set.

  - schemas: migrate sign-in experience types from core to schemas

- 754d0e134: pagination is now optional for `GET /api/organizations/:id/users/:userId/roles`

  The default pagination is now removed. This isn't considered a breaking change, but we marked it as minor to get your attention.

- 87615d58c: support machine-to-machine apps for organizations

  This feature allows machine-to-machine apps to be associated with organizations, and be assigned with organization roles.

  ### Console

  - Add a new "machine-to-machine" type to organization roles. All existing roles are now "user" type.
  - You can manage machine-to-machine apps in the organization details page -> Machine-to-machine apps section.
  - You can view the associated organizations in the machine-to-machine app details page.

  ### OpenID Connect grant

  The `client_credentials` grant type is now supported for organizations. You can use this grant type to obtain an access token for an organization.

  ### Management API

  A set of new endpoints are added to the Management API:

  - `/api/organizations/{id}/applications` to manage machine-to-machine apps.
  - `/api/organizations/{id}/applications/{applicationId}` to manage a specific machine-to-machine app in an organization.
  - `/api/applications/{id}/organizations` to view the associated organizations of a machine-to-machine app.

- 061a30a87: support agree to terms polices for Logto’s sign-in experiences

  - Automatic: Users automatically agree to terms by continuing to use the service
  - ManualRegistrationOnly: Users must agree to terms by checking a box during registration, and don't need to agree when signing in
  - Manual: Users must agree to terms by checking a box during registration or signing in

- ef21c7a99: support per-organization multi-factor authentication requirement

  An organization can now require its member to have multi-factor authentication (MFA) configured. If an organization has this requirement and a member does not have MFA configured, the member will not be able to fetch the organization access token.

- b52609a1e: add `hasPassword` to custom JWT user context
- efa884c40: feature: just-in-time user provisioning for organizations

  This feature allows users to automatically join the organization and be assigned roles upon their first sign-in through some authentication methods. You can set requirements to meet for just-in-time provisioning.

  ### Email domains

  New users will automatically join organizations with just-in-time provisioning if they:

  - Sign up with verified email addresses, or;
  - Use social sign-in with verified email addresses.

  This applies to organizations that have the same email domain configured.

  To enable this feature, you can add email domain via the Management API or the Logto Console:

  - We added the following new endpoints to the Management API:
    - `GET /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/email-domains`
    - `POST /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/email-domains`
    - `PUT /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/email-domains`
    - `DELETE /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/email-domains/{emailDomain}`
  - In the Logto Console, you can manage email domains in the organization details page -> "Just-in-time provisioning" section.

  ### SSO connectors

  New or existing users signing in through enterprise SSO for the first time will automatically join organizations that have just-in-time provisioning configured for the SSO connector.

  To enable this feature, you can add SSO connectors via the Management API or the Logto Console:

  - We added the following new endpoints to the Management API:
    - `GET /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/sso-connectors`
    - `POST /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/sso-connectors`
    - `PUT /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/sso-connectors`
    - `DELETE /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/sso-connectors/{ssoConnectorId}`
  - In the Logto Console, you can manage SSO connectors in the organization details page -> "Just-in-time provisioning" section.

  ### Default organization roles

  You can also configure the default roles for users provisioned via this feature. The default roles will be assigned to the user when they are provisioned.

  To enable this feature, you can set the default roles via the Management API or the Logto Console:

  - We added the following new endpoints to the Management API:
    - `GET /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/roles`
    - `POST /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/roles`
    - `PUT /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/roles`
    - `DELETE /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/roles/{organizationRoleId}`
  - In the Logto Console, you can manage default roles in the organization details page -> "Just-in-time provisioning" section.

- b50ba0b7e: enable backchannel logout support

  Enable the support of [OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0.html).

  To register for backchannel logout, navigate to the application details page in the Logto Console and locate the "Backchannel logout" section. Enter the backchannel logout URL of your RP and click "Save".

  You can also enable session requirements for backchannel logout. When enabled, Logto will include the `sid` claim in the logout token.

  For programmatic registration, you can set the `backchannelLogoutUri` and `backchannelLogoutSessionRequired` properties in the application `oidcClientMetadata` object.

### Patch Changes

- d60f6ce48: build `operationId` for Management API in OpenAPI response (credit to @mostafa)

  As per [the specification](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/paths-and-operations/):

  > `operationId` is an optional unique string used to identify an operation. If provided, these IDs must be unique among all operations described in your API.

  This greatly simplifies the creation of client SDKs in different languages, because it generates more meaningful function names instead of auto-generated ones, like the following examples:

  ```diff
  - org, _, err := s.Client.OrganizationsAPI.ApiOrganizationsIdGet(ctx, req.GetId()).Execute()
  + org, _, err := s.Client.OrganizationsAPI.GetOrganization(ctx, req.GetId()).Execute()
  ```

  ```diff
  - users, _, err := s.Client.OrganizationsAPI.ApiOrganizationsIdUsersGet(ctx, req.GetId()).Execute()
  + users, _, err := s.Client.OrganizationsAPI.ListOrganizationUsers(ctx, req.GetId()).Execute()
  ```

- 7a279be1f: add user detail data payload to the `User.Deleted` webhook event
- d51e839cd: fix OpenAPI schema returned by the `GET /api/swagger.json` endpoint

  1. The `:` character is invalid in parameter names, such as `organizationId:root`. These characters have been replaced with `-`.
  2. The `tenantId` parameter of the `/api/.well-known/endpoints/{tenantId}` route was missing from the generated OpenAPI spec document, resulting in validation errors. This has been fixed.

### Minor Changes

- b5104d8c1: add new webhook events

  We introduce a new event type `DataHook` to unlock a series of events that can be triggered by data updates (mostly Management API):

  - User.Created
  - User.Deleted
  - User.Data.Updated
  - User.SuspensionStatus.Updated
  - Role.Created
  - Role.Deleted
  - Role.Data.Updated
  - Role.Scopes.Updated
  - Scope.Created
  - Scope.Deleted
  - Scope.Data.Updated
  - Organization.Created
  - Organization.Deleted
  - Organization.Data.Updated
  - Organization.Membership.Updated
  - OrganizationRole.Created
  - OrganizationRole.Deleted
  - OrganizationRole.Data.Updated
  - OrganizationRole.Scopes.Updated
  - OrganizationScope.Created
  - OrganizationScope.Deleted
  - OrganizationScope.Data.Updated

  DataHook events are triggered when the data associated with the event is updated via management API request or user interaction actions.

  ### Management API triggered events

- 0c70d65c7: define new `sso_identities` user claim to the userinfo endpoint response

  - Define a new `sso_identities` user claim that will be used to store the user's SSO identities. The claim will be an array of objects with the following properties:
    - `details`: detailed user info returned from the SSO provider.
    - `issuer`: the issuer of the SSO provider.
    - `identityId`: the user id of the user in the SSO provider.
  - The new claims will share the same scope as the social `identities` claim.
  - When the user `identities` scope is requested, the new `sso_identities` claim will be returned along with the `identities` claim in the userinfo endpoint response.

- 76fd33b7e: support default roles for users

### Patch Changes

- 558986d28: update documentation reference links
- 458746c9a: fix Microsoft EntraID OIDC SSO connector invalid authorization code response bug

  - For public organizations access EntraID OIDC applications, the token endpoint returns `expires_in` value type in number.
  - For private organization access only applications, the token endpoint returns `expires_in` value type in string.
  - Expected `expires_in` value type is number. (See [v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow#successful-response-2) for reference)

  String type `expires_in` value is not supported by the current Microsoft EntraID OIDC connector, a invalid authorization response error will be thrown.
  Update the token response guard to handle both number and string type `expires_in` value. Make the SSO connector more robust.

## 1.16.0

### Minor Changes

- 8ef021fb3: add support for Redis Cluster and extra TLS options for Redis connections
- 21bb35b12: refactor the definition of hook event types

  - Add `DataHook` event types. `DataHook` are triggered by data changes.
  - Add "interaction" prefix to existing hook event types. Interaction hook events are triggered by end user interactions, e.g. completing sign-in.

- e8c41b164: support organization custom data

  Now you can save additional data associated with the organization with the organization-level `customData` field by:

  - Edit in the Console organization details page.
  - Specify `customData` field when using organization Management APIs.

- 5872172cb: enable custom JWT feature for OSS version

  OSS version users can now use custom JWT feature to add custom claims to JWT access tokens payload (previously, this feature was only available to Logto Cloud).

- 1ef32d6d5: update token grant to support organization API resources

  Organization roles can be assigned with scopes (permissions) from the API resources, and the token grant now supports this.

  Once the user is consent to an application with "resources" assigned, the token grant will now include the scopes inherited from all assigned organization roles.

  Users can narrow down the scopes by passing `organization_id` when granting an access token, and the token will only include the scopes from the organization roles of the specified organization, the access token will contain an extra claim `organization_id` to indicate the organization the token is granted for. Then the resource server can use this claim to protect the resource with additional organization-level authorization.

  This change is backward compatible, and the existing token grant will continue to work as before.

### Patch Changes

- 52df3ebbb: Bug fix: organization invitation APIs should handle invitee emails case insensitively
- 368385b93: Management API will not return 500 in production for status codes that are not listed in the OpenAPI spec
- d54530356: Fix OIDC AccessDenied error code to 403.

  This error may happen when you try to grant an access token to a user lacking the required permissions, especially when granting for orgnization related resources. The error code should be 403 instead of 400.

- 5b03030de: Not allow to modify management API resource through API.

  Previously, management API resource and its scopes are readonly in Console. But it was possible to modify through the API. This is not allowed anymore.

- 5660c54cb: Sign out user after deletion or suspension

  When a user is deleted or suspended through Management API, they should be signed out immediately, including sessions and refresh tokens.

- a9ccfc738: implement request ID for API requests

  - All requests will now include a request ID in the headers (`Logto-Core-Request-Id`)
  - Terminal logs will now include the request ID as the prefix

- bbd399e15: fix the new user from SSO register hook event not triggering bug

  ### Issue

  When a new user registers via SSO, the `PostRegister` interaction hook event is not triggered. `PostSignIn` event is mistakenly triggered instead.

  ### Root Cause

  In the SSO `post /api/interaction/sso/:connectionId/registration` API, we update the interaction event to `Register`.
  However, the hook middleware reads the event from interaction session ahead of the API logic, and the event is not updated resulting in the wrong event being triggered.

  In the current interaction API design, we should mutate the interaction event by calling the `PUT /api/interaction/event` API, instead of updating the event directly in the submit interaction APIs. (Just like the no direct mutation rule for a react state). So we can ensure the correct side effect like logs and hooks are triggered properly.

  All the other sign-in methods are using the `PUT /api/interaction/event` API to update the event. But when implementing the SSO registration API, we were trying to reduce the API requests and directly updated the event in the registration API which will submit the interaction directly.

  ### Solution

  Remove the event update logic in the SSO registration API and call the `PUT /api/interaction/event` API to update the event.
  This will ensure the correct event is triggered in the hook middleware.

  ### Action Items

  Align the current interaction API design for now.
  Need to improve the session/interaction API logic to simplify the whole process.

- b4b8015db: fix a bug that prevents invitee from accepting the organization invitation if the email letter case is not matching
- b575f57ac: Support comma separated resource parameter

  Some third-party libraries or plugins do not support array of resources, and can only specify `resource` through `additionalParameters` config, e.g. `flutter-appauth`. However, only one resource can be specified at a time in this way. This PR enables comma separated resource parameter support in Logto core service, so that multiple resources can be specified via a single string.

  For example: Auth URL like `/oidc/auth?resource=https://example.com/api1,https://example.com/api2` will be interpreted and parsed to Logto core service as `/ordc/auth?resource=https://example.com/api1&resource=https://example.com/api2`.

## 1.15.0

### Minor Changes

- 172411946: Add avatar and customData fields to create user API (POST /api/users)
- abffb9f95: full oidc standard claims support

  We have added support for the remaining [OpenID Connect standard claims](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims). Now, these claims are accessible in both ID tokens and the response from the `/me` endpoint.

  Additionally, we adhere to the standard scopes - claims mapping. This means that you can retrieve most of the profile claims using the `profile` scope, and the `address` claim can be obtained by using the `address` scope.

  For all newly introduced claims, we store them in the `user.profile` field.

  > ![Note]
  > Unlike other database fields (e.g. `name`), the claims stored in the `profile` field will fall back to `undefined` rather than `null`. We refrain from using `?? null` here to reduce the size of ID tokens, since `undefined` fields will be stripped in tokens.

- 2cbc591ff: support `first_screen` parameter in authentication request

  Sign-in experience can be initiated with a specific screen by setting the `first_screen` parameter in the OIDC authentication request. This parameter is intended to replace the `interaction_mode` parameter, which is now deprecated.

  The `first_screen` parameter can have the following values:

  - `signIn`: The sign-in screen is displayed first.
  - `register`: The registration screen is displayed first.

  Here's a non-normative example of how to use the `first_screen` parameter:

  ```
  GET /authorize?
    response_type=code
    &client_id=your_client_id
    &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb
    &scope=openid
    &state=af0ifjsldkj
    &nonce=n-0S6_WzA2Mj
    &first_screen=signIn
  ```

  When `first_screen` is set, the legacy `interaction_mode` parameter is ignored.

- 468558721: Get organization roles with search keyword.
- cc01acbd0: Create a new user through API with password digest and corresponding algorithm
- 2cbc591ff: support direct sign-in

  Instead of showing a screen for the user to choose between the sign-in methods, a specific sign-in method can be initiated directly by setting the `direct_sign_in` parameter in the OIDC authentication request.

  This parameter follows the format of `direct_sign_in=<method>:<target>`, where:

  - `<method>` is the sign-in method to trigger. Currently the only supported value is `social`.
  - `<target>` is the target value for the sign-in method. If the method is `social`, the value is the social connector's `target`.

  When a valid `direct_sign_in` parameter is set, the first screen will be skipped and the specified sign-in method will be triggered immediately upon entering the sign-in experience. If the parameter is invalid, the default behavior of showing the first screen will be used.

### Patch Changes

- 7c22c50cb: Fix SSO connector new user authentication internal server error.

  ## Description

  Thanks to the [issue](https://github.com/logto-io/logto/issues/5502) report, we found that the SSO connector new user authentication was causing an internal server error. Should return an 422 status code instead of 500. Frontend sign-in page can not handle the 500 error and complete the new user registration process.

  ### Root cause

  When the SSO connector returns a new user that does not exist in the Logto database, the backend with throw a 422 error. Frontend relies the 422 error to redirect and complete the new user registration process.

  However, the backend was throwing a 500 error instead. That is because we applied a strict API response status code guard at the koaGuard middleware level. The status code 422 was not listed. Therefore, the middleware threw a 500 error.

  ### Solution

  We added the 422 status code to the koaGuard middleware. Now, the backend will return a 422 status code when the SSO connector returns a new user that does not exist in the Logto database. The frontend sign-in page can handle the 422 error and complete the new user registration process.

## 1.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 32df9acde: implement Logto core API to support the new third-party application feature, and user consent interaction flow

  ### Management API

  - Add new endpoint `/applications/sign-in-experiences` with `PUT`, `GET` methods to manage the application level sign-in experiences.
  - Add new endpoint `/applications/:id/users/:userId/consent-organizations` with `PUT`, `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE` methods to manage the user granted organizations for the third-party application.
  - Add new endpoint `/applications/:id/user-consent-scopes` with `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE` methods to manage the user consent resource, organization, and user scopes for the third-party application.
  - Update the `/applications` endpoint to include the new `is_third_party` field. Support create third-party applications, and query by `is_third_party` field.

  ### Interaction API

  - Add the `koaAutoConsent` to support the auto-consent interaction flow for the first-party application. If is the first-party application we can auto-consent the requested scopes. If is the third-party application we need to redirect the user to the consent page to get the user consent manually.
  - Add the `GET /interaction/consent` endpoint to support fetching the consent context for the user consent page. Including the application detail, authenticated user info, all the requested scopes and user organizations info (if requested scopes include the organization scope).
  - Update the `POST /interaction/consent` endpoint to support the user consent interaction flow. Including grant all the missing scopes, and update the user granted organizations for the third-party application.

- 31e60811d: use Node 20 LTS for engine requirement.

  Note: We mark it as minor because Logto is shipping with Docker image and it's not a breaking change for users.

### Patch Changes

- 9222eb9f8: Set `on conflict do nothing` for all the `RelationQueries` insert operation.

  - For all the relation table entities, we want to safely insert them into the database. If the relation entity already exists, instead of throwing an error, we ignore the insert operation, especially on a batch insert. Unlike other resource data entities, user does not care if the relation entity already exists. Therefore, we want to silently ignore the insert operation if the relation entity already exists.

- becf59169: introduce Logto Organizations

  The term "organization" is also used in other forms, such as "workspace", "team", "company", etc. In Logto, we use "organization" as the generic term to represent the concept of multi-tenancy.

  From now, you can create multiple organizations in Logto, each of which can have its own users, while in the same identity pool.

  Plus, we also introduce the concept of "organization template". It is a set of permissions and roles that applies to all organizations, while a user can have different roles in different organizations.

  See [🏢 Organizations (Multi-tenancy)](https://docs.logto.io/docs/recipes/organizations/) for more details.

### Patch Changes

- b05fb2960: add summary and description to APIs
- 9a4da065d: fix incorrect swagger components
- b4f702a86: userinfo endpoint will return `organization_data` claim if organization scope is requested

  The claim includes all organizations that the user is a member of with the following structure:

  ```json
  {
    "organization_data": [
      {
        "id": "organization_id",
        "name": "organization_name",
        "description": "organization_description"
      }
    ]
  }

### Minor Changes

- 6727f629d: feature: introduce multi-factor authentication

  We're excited to announce that Logto now supports multi-factor authentication (MFA) for your sign-in experience. Navigate to the "Multi-factor auth" tab to configure how you want to secure your users' accounts.

  In this release, we introduce the following MFA methods:

  - Authenticator app OTP: users can add any authenticator app that supports the TOTP standard, such as Google Authenticator, Duo, etc.
  - WebAuthn (Passkey): users can use the standard WebAuthn protocol to register a hardware security key, such as biometric keys, Yubikey, etc.
  - Backup codes：users can generate a set of backup codes to use when they don't have access to other MFA methods.

  For a smooth transition, we also support to configure the MFA policy to require MFA for sign-in experience, or to allow users to opt-in to MFA.

### Patch Changes

- bbe7f0b8e: refactored swagger json api

  - reuse parameter definitions, which reduces the size of the swagger response.

## 1.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 03bc7888b: machine-to-machine (M2M) role-based access control (RBAC)

  ### Summary

  This feature enables Logto users to apply role-based access control (RBAC) to their machine-to-machine (M2M) applications.

  With the update, Logto users can now effectively manage permissions for their M2M applications, resulting in improved security and flexibility.

  Following new APIs are added for M2M role management:

  **Applications**

  - `POST /applications/:appId/roles` assigns role(s) to the M2M application
  - `DELETE /applications/:appId/roles/:roleId` deletes the role from the M2M application
  - `GET /applications/:appId/roles` lists all roles assigned to the M2M application

  **Roles**

  - `POST /roles/:roleId/applications` assigns the role to multiple M2M applications
  - `DELETE /roles/:roleId/applications/:appId` removes the M2M application assigned to the role
  - `GET /roles/:roleId/applications` lists all M2M applications granted with the role

  Updated following API:

  **Roles**

  - `POST /roles` to specify the role type (either `user` or `machine-to-machine` role)

  **Users**

  - `POST /users/:userId/roles` to prevent assigning M2M roles to end-users

- 2c340d379: support `roles` scope for ID token to issue `roles` claim

## 1.9.0

### Minor Changes

- e8b0b1d02: feature: password policy

  ### Summary

  This feature enables custom password policy for users. Now it is possible to guard with the following rules when a user is creating a new password:

  - Minimum length (default: `8`)
  - Minimum character types (default: `1`)
  - If the password has been pwned (default: `true`)
  - If the password is exactly the same as or made up of the restricted phrases:
    - Repetitive or sequential characters (default: `true`)
    - User information (default: `true`)
    - Custom words (default: `[]`)

  If you are an existing Logto Cloud user or upgrading from a previous version, to ensure a smooth experience, we'll keep the original policy as much as possible:

  > The original password policy requires a minimum length of 8 and at least 2 character types (letters, numbers, and symbols).

  Note in the new policy implementation, it is not possible to combine lower and upper case letters into one character type. So the original password policy will be translated into the following:

  - Minimum length: `8`
  - Minimum character types: `2`
  - Pwned: `false`
  - Repetitive or sequential characters: `false`
  - User information: `false`
  - Custom words: `[]`

  If you want to change the policy, you can do it:

  - Logto Console -> Sign-in experience -> Password policy.
  - Update `passwordPolicy` property in the sign-in experience via Management API.

  ### Side effects

  - All new users will be affected by the new policy immediately.
  - Existing users will not be affected by the new policy until they change their password.
  - We removed password restrictions when adding or updating a user via Management API.

- 3d9885233: ## Bump oidc-provider version

  Bump oidc-provider version to [v8.2.2](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider/releases/tag/v8.2.2). This version fixes a bug that prevented the revoked scopes from being removed from the access token.

  > Issued Access Tokens always only contain scopes that are defined on the respective Resource Server (returned from features.resourceIndicators.getResourceServerInfo).

  If the scopes are revoked from the resource server, they should be removed from the newly granted access token. This is now fixed in the new version of oidc-provider.

### Major Changes

- c12717412: **Decouple users and admins**

  ## 💥 BREAKING CHANGES 💥

  Logto was using a single port to serve both normal users and admins, as well as the web console. While we continuously maintain a high level of security, it’ll still be great to decouple these components into two separate parts to keep data isolated and provide a flexible infrastructure.

  From this version, Logto now listens to two ports by default, one for normal users (`3001`), and one for admins (`3002`).

  - Nothing changed for normal users. No adaption is needed.
  - For admin users:
    - The default Admin Console URL has been changed to `http://localhost:3002/console`.
    - To change the admin port, set the environment variable `ADMIN_PORT`. For instance, `ADMIN_PORT=3456`.
    - You can specify a custom endpoint for admins by setting the environment variable `ADMIN_ENDPOINT`. For example, `ADMIN_ENDPOINT=https://admin.your-domain.com`.
    - You can now completely disable admin endpoints by setting `ADMIN_DISABLE_LOCALHOST=1` and leaving `ADMIN_ENDPOINT` unset.
    - Admin Console and admin user data are not accessible via normal user endpoints, including `localhost` and `ENDPOINT` from the environment.
    - Admin Console no longer displays audit logs of admin users. However, these logs still exist in the database, and Logto still inserts admin user logs. There is just no convenient interface to inspect them.
    - Due to the data isolation, the numbers on the dashboard may slightly decrease (admins are excluded).

  If you are upgrading from a previous version, simply run the database alteration command as usual, and we'll take care of the rest.

  > **Note** DID YOU KNOW
  >
  > Under the hood, we use the powerful Postgres feature Row-Level Security to isolate admin and user data.

- 1c9160112: Packages are now ESM.
- 343b1090f: **💥 BREAKING CHANGE 💥** Move `/api/phrase` API to `/api/.well-known/phrases`
- f41fd3f05: drop settings table and add systems table

  **BREAKING CHANGES**

  - core: removed `GET /settings` and `PATCH /settings` API
  - core: added `GET /configs/admin-console` and `PATCH /configs/admin-console` API
    - `/configs/*` APIs are config/key-specific now. they may have different logic per key
  - cli: change valid `logto db config` keys by removing `alterationState` and adding `adminConsole` since:
    - OIDC configs and admin console configs are tenant-level configs (the concept of "tenant" can be ignored until we officially announce it)
    - alteration state is still a system-wide config

### Minor Changes

- c12717412: - mask sensitive password value in audit logs
- f41fd3f05: Replace `passcode` naming convention in the interaction APIs and main flow ui with `verificationCode`.
- c12717412: ## Creating your social connector with ease

  We’re excited to announce that Logto now supports standard protocols (SAML, OIDC, and OAuth2.0) for creating social connectors to integrate external identity providers. Each protocol can create multiple social connectors, giving you more control over your access needs.

  To simplify the process of configuring social connectors, we’re replacing code-edit with simple forms. SAML already supports form configuration, with other connectors coming soon. This means you don’t need to compare documents or worry about code format.

- c12717412: ## Enable connector method `getUserInfo` read and write access to DB

  Logto connectors are designed to be stateless to the extent possible and practical, but it still has some exceptions at times.

  With the recent addition of database read and write access, connectors can now store persistent information. For example, connectors can now store access tokens and refresh tokens to minimize number of requests to social vendor's APIs.

- 343b1090f: - Automatically create a new tenant for new cloud users
  - Support path-based multi-tenancy
- 343b1090f: Add storage provider: S3Storage
- 343b1090f: Allow admin tenant admin to create tenants without limitation
- 343b1090f: ### Add privacy policy url

  In addition to the terms of service url, we also provide a privacy policy url field in the sign-in-experience settings. To better support the end-users' privacy declaration needs.

- 18e3b82e6: Add user suspend API endpoint

  Use `PATCH /api/users/:userId/is-suspended` to update a user's suspended state, once a user is suspended, all refresh tokens belong to this user will be revoked.

  Suspended users will get an error toast when trying to sign in.

- 343b1090f: Add API for uploading user images to storage providers: Azure Storage.
- f41fd3f05: Officially cleanup all deprecated `/session` APIs in core and all the related integration tests.
- 343b1090f: **Add `sessionNotFoundRedirectUrl` tenant config**

  - User can use this optional config to designate the URL to redirect if session not found in Sign-in Experience.
  - Session guard now works for root path as well.

- 343b1090f: New feature: User account settings page

  - We have removed the previous settings page and moved it to the account settings page. You can access to the new settings menu by clicking the user avatar in the top right corner.
  - You can directly change the language or theme from the popover menu, and explore more account settings by clicking the "Profile" menu item.

- 343b1090f: remove the branding style config and make the logo URL config optional
- c12717412: **Customize CSS for Sign-in Experience**

  We have put a lot of effort into improving the user sign-in experience and have provided a brand color option for the UI. However, we know that fine-tuning UI requirements can be unpredictable. While Logto is still exploring the best options for customization, we want to provide a programmatic method to unblock your development.

  You can now use the Management API `PATCH /api/sign-in-exp` with body `{ "customCss": "arbitrary string" }` to set customized CSS for the sign-in experience. You should see the value of `customCss` attached after `<title>` of the page. If the style has a higher priority, it should be able to override.

  > **Note**
  >
  > Since Logto uses CSS Modules, you may see a hash value in the `class` property of DOM elements (e.g. a `<div>` with `vUugRG_container`). To override these, you can use the `$=` CSS selector to match elements that end with a specified value. In this case, it should be `div[class$=container]`.

- 2168936b9: **Sign-in Experience v2**

  We are thrilled to announce the release of the newest version of the Sign-in Experience, which includes more ways to sign-in and sign-up, as well as a framework that is easier to understand and more flexible to configure in the Admin Console.

  When compared to Sign-in Experience v1, this version’s capability was expanded so that it could support a greater variety of flexible use cases. For example, now users can sign up with email verification code and sign in with email and password.

  We hope that this will be able to assist developers in delivering a successful sign-in flow, which will also be appreciated by the end users.

### Major Changes

- c12717412: **Decouple users and admins**

  ## 💥 BREAKING CHANGES 💥

  Logto was using a single port to serve both normal users and admins, as well as the web console. While we continuously maintain a high level of security, it’ll still be great to decouple these components into two separate parts to keep data isolated and provide a flexible infrastructure.

  From this version, Logto now listens to two ports by default, one for normal users (`3001`), and one for admins (`3002`).

  - Nothing changed for normal users. No adaption is needed.
  - For admin users:
    - The default Admin Console URL has been changed to `http://localhost:3002/console`.
    - To change the admin port, set the environment variable `ADMIN_PORT`. For instance, `ADMIN_PORT=3456`.
    - You can specify a custom endpoint for admins by setting the environment variable `ADMIN_ENDPOINT`. For example, `ADMIN_ENDPOINT=https://admin.your-domain.com`.
    - You can now completely disable admin endpoints by setting `ADMIN_DISABLE_LOCALHOST=1` and leaving `ADMIN_ENDPOINT` unset.
    - Admin Console and admin user data are not accessible via normal user endpoints, including `localhost` and `ENDPOINT` from the environment.
    - Admin Console no longer displays audit logs of admin users. However, these logs still exist in the database, and Logto still inserts admin user logs. There is just no convenient interface to inspect them.
    - Due to the data isolation, the numbers on the dashboard may slightly decrease (admins are excluded).

  If you are upgrading from a previous version, simply run the database alteration command as usual, and we'll take care of the rest.

  > **Note** DID YOU KNOW
  >
  > Under the hood, we use the powerful Postgres feature Row-Level Security to isolate admin and user data.

### Minor Changes

- c12717412: - mask sensitive password value in audit logs
- c12717412: ## Creating your social connector with ease

  We’re excited to announce that Logto now supports standard protocols (SAML, OIDC, and OAuth2.0) for creating social connectors to integrate external identity providers. Each protocol can create multiple social connectors, giving you more control over your access needs.

  To simplify the process of configuring social connectors, we’re replacing code-edit with simple forms. SAML already supports form configuration, with other connectors coming soon. This means you don’t need to compare documents or worry about code format.

- c12717412: ## Enable connector method `getUserInfo` read and write access to DB

  Logto connectors are designed to be stateless to the extent possible and practical, but it still has some exceptions at times.

  With the recent addition of database read and write access, connectors can now store persistent information. For example, connectors can now store access tokens and refresh tokens to minimize number of requests to social vendor's APIs.

- c12717412: **Customize CSS for Sign-in Experience**

  We have put a lot of effort into improving the user sign-in experience and have provided a brand color option for the UI. However, we know that fine-tuning UI requirements can be unpredictable. While Logto is still exploring the best options for customization, we want to provide a programmatic method to unblock your development.

  **BREAKING CHANGES**

  - core: removed `GET /settings` and `PATCH /settings` API
