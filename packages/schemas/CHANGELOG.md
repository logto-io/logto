### Minor Changes

- 13d04d776: feat: support multiple sign-up identifiers in sign-in experience

  ## New update

  Introduces a new optional field, `secondaryIdentifiers`, to the sign-in experience sign-up settings. This enhancement allows developers to specify multiple required user identifiers during the user sign-up process. Available options include `email`, `phone`, `username` and `emailOrPhone`.

  ### Explanation of the difference between `signUp.identifiers` and new `signUp.secondaryIdentifiers`

  The existing `signUp.identifiers` field represents the sign-up identifiers enabled for user sign-up and is an array type. In this legacy setup, if multiple identifiers are provided, users can complete the sign-up process using any one of them. The only multi-value case allowed is `[email, phone]`, which signifies that users can provide either an email or a phone number.

  To enhance flexibility and support multiple required sign-up identifiers, the existing `signUp.identifiers` field does not suffice. To maintain backward compatibility with existing data, we have introduced this new `secondaryIdentifiers` field.

  Unlike the `signUp.identifiers` field, the `signUp.secondaryIdentifiers` array follows an `AND` logic, meaning that all elements listed in this field are required during the sign-up process, in addition to the primary identifiers. This new field also accommodates the `emailOrPhone` case by defining an exclusive `emailOrPhone` value type, which indicates that either a phone number or an email address must be provided.

  In summary, while `identifiers` allows for optional selection among email and phone, `secondaryIdentifiers` enforces mandatory inclusion of all specified identifiers.

  ### Examples

  1. `username` as the primary identifier. In addition, user will be required to provide a verified `email` and `phone number` during the sign-up process.

  ```json
  {
    "identifiers": ["username"],
    "secondaryIdentifiers": [
      {
        "type": "email",
        "verify": true
      },
      {
        "type": "phone",
        "verify": true
      }
    ],
    "verify": true,
    "password": true
  }
  ```

  2. `username` as the primary identifier. In addition, user will be required to provide either a verified `email` or `phone number` during the sign-up process.

  ```json
  {
    "identifiers": ["username"],
    "secondaryIdentifiers": [
      {
        "type": "emailOrPhone",
        "verify": true
      }
    ],
    "verify": true,
    "password": true
  }
  ```

  3. `email` or `phone number` as the primary identifier. In addition, user will be required to provide a `username` during the sign-up process.

  ```json
  {
    "identifiers": ["email", "phone"],
    "secondaryIdentifiers": [
      {
        "type": "username",
        "verify": true
      }
    ],
    "verify": true,
    "password": false
  }
  ```

  ### Sign-in experience settings

  - `@logto/core`: Update the `/api/sign-in-experience` endpoint to support the new `secondaryIdentifiers` field in the sign-up settings.
  - `@logto/console`: Replace the sign-up identifier single selector with a multi-selector to support multiple sign-up identifiers. The order of the identifiers can be rearranged by dragging and dropping the items in the list. The first item in the list will be considered the primary identifier and stored in the `signUp.identifiers` field, while the rest will be stored in the `signUp.secondaryIdentifiers` field.

  ### End-user experience

  The sign-up flow is now split into two stages:

  - Primary identifiers (`signUp.identifiers`) are collected in the first-screen registration screen.
  - Secondary identifiers (`signUp.secondaryIdentifiers`) are requested in subsequent steps after the primary registration has been submitted.

  ## Other refactors

  We have fully decoupled the sign-up identifier settings from the sign-in methods. Developers can now require as many user identifiers as needed during the sign-up process without impacting the sign-in process.

  The following restrictions on sign-in and sign-up settings have been removed:

  1. Password requirement is now optional when `username` is configured as a sign-up identifier. However, users without passwords cannot sign in using username authentication.
  2. Removed the constraint requiring sign-up identifiers to be enabled as sign-in methods.
  3. Removed the requirement for password verification across all sign-in methods when password is enabled for sign-up.

### Patch Changes

## 1.25.0

### Minor Changes

- 1c7bdf9ba: add legacy password type supporting custom hasing function, credits @fre2d0m

  You can now set the type of `password_encryption_method` to `legacy`, and store info with a JSON string format (containing a hash algorithm, arguments, and an encrypted password) in the `password_encrypted` field. By doing this, you can use any hash algorithm supported by Node.js, this is useful when migrating from other password hash algorithms, especially for the ones that include salt.

  The format of the JSON string is as follows:

  ```json
  ["hash_algorithm", ["argument1", "argument2", ...], "expected_hashed_value"]
  ```

  And you can use `@` as the input password in the arguments.

  For example, if you are using SHA256 with a salt, you can store the password in the following format:

  ```json
  [
    "sha256",
    ["salt123", "@"],
    "c465f66c6ac481a7a17e9ed5b4e2e7e7288d892f12bf1c95c140901e9a70436e"
  ]
  ```

  Then when the user uses the password (`password123`), the `legacyVerify` function will use the `sha256` algorithm with the `salt123` and the input password to verify the password.

  In this case, `salt123` is the first argument, `@` is the input password, then the following code will be executed:

  ```ts
  const hash = crypto.createHash("sha256");
  hash.update("salt123" + "password123");
  const expectedHashedValue = hash.digest("hex");
  ```

### Minor Changes

- f1b1d9e95: new MFA prompt policy

  You can now cutomize the MFA prompt policy in the Console.

  First, choose if you want to enable **Require MFA**:

  - **Enable**: Users will be prompted to set up MFA during the sign-in process which cannot be skipped. If the user fails to set up MFA or deletes their MFA settings, they will be locked out of their account until they set up MFA again.
  - **Disable**: Users can skip the MFA setup process during sign-up flow.

  If you choose to **Disable**, you can choose the MFA setup prompt:

  - Do not ask users to set up MFA.
  - Ask users to set up MFA during registration (skippable, one-time prompt). **The same prompt as previous policy (UserControlled)**
  - Ask users to set up MFA on their sign-in after registration (skippable, one-time prompt)

## 1.22.0

### Minor Changes

- 640425414: display support email and website info on experience error pages.

  Added support email and website info to the error pages of the experience app. E.g. when a user tries to access a page that doesn't exist, or when the social session is not found in a social callback page. This will help users to contact support easily when they encounter an error.

  You may configure the support email and website info in the sign-in experience settings page in the Logto console or through the management API.

- 7ebef18e3: add account api

  Introduce the new Account API, designed to give end users direct API access without needing to go through the Management API, here is the highlights:

  1. Direct access: The Account API empowers end users to directly access and manage their own account profile without requiring the relay of Management API.
  2. User profile and identities management: Users can fully manage their profiles and security settings, including the ability to update identity information like email, phone, and password, as well as manage social connections. MFA and SSO support are coming soon.
  3. Global access control: Admin has full, global control over access settings, can customize each fields.
  4. Seamless authorization: Authorizing is easier than ever! Simply use `client.getAccessToken()` to obtain an opaque access token for OP (Logto), and attach it to the Authorization header as `Bearer <access_token>`.

  ## Get started

  > ![Note]
  > Go to the [Logto Docs](https://bump.sh/logto/doc/logto-user-api) to find full API reference.

  1. Use `/api/account-center` endpoint to enable the feature, for security reason, it is disabled by default. And set fields permission for each field.
  2. Use `client.getAccessToken()` to get the access token.
  3. Attach the access token to the Authorization header of your request, and start interacting with the Account API directly from the frontend.
  4. You may need to setup `logto-verification-id` header as an additional verification for some requests related to identity verification.

  ## What you can do with Account API

  1. Get user account profile
  2. Update basic information including name, avatar, username and other profile information
  3. Update password
  4. Update primary email
  5. Update primary phone
  6. Manage social identities

- 640425414: add unknown session redirect url in the sign-in experience settings

  In certain cases, Logto may be unable to properly identify a user’s authentication session when they land on the sign-in page. This can happen if the session has expired, if the user bookmarks the sign-in URL for future access, or if they directly share the sign-in link. By default, an "unknown session" 404 error is displayed.

  To improve user experience, we have added a new `unknownSessionRedirectUrl` field in the sign-in experience settings.You can configure this field to redirect users to a custom URL when an unknown session is detected. This will help users to easily navigate to your client application or website and reinitiate the authentication process automatically.

### Minor Changes

- e0326c96c: Add personal access token (PAT)

  Personal access tokens (PATs) provide a secure way for users to grant access tokens without using their credentials and interactive sign-in.

  You can create a PAT by going to the user's detail page in Console or using the Management API `POST /users/:userId/personal-access-tokens`.

  To use a PAT, call the token exchange endpoint `POST /oidc/token` with the following parameters:

  1. `grant_type`: REQUIRED. The value of this parameter must be `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange` indicates that a token exchange is being performed.
  2. `resource`: OPTIONAL. The resource indicator, the same as other token requests.
  3. `scope`: OPTIONAL. The requested scopes, the same as other token requests.
  4. `subject_token`: REQUIRED. The user's PAT.
  5. `subject_token_type`: REQUIRED. The type of the security token provided in the `subject_token` parameter. The value of this parameter must be `urn:logto:token-type:personal_access_token`.
  6. `client_id`: REQUIRED. The client identifier of the client application that is making the request, the returned access token will contain this client_id claim.

  And the response will be a JSON object with the following properties:

  1. `access_token`: REQUIRED. The access token of the user, which is the same as other token requests like `authorization_code` or `refresh_token`.
  2. `issued_token_type`: REQUIRED. The type of the issued token. The value of this parameter must be `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token`.
  3. `token_type`: REQUIRED. The type of the token. The value of this parameter must be `Bearer`.
  4. `expires_in`: REQUIRED. The lifetime in seconds of the access token.
  5. `scope`: OPTIONAL. The scopes of the access token.

- 25187ef63: add support for `login_hint` parameter in sign-in method

  This feature allows you to provide a suggested identifier (email, phone, or username) for the user, improving the sign-in experience especially in scenarios where the user's identifier is known or can be inferred.

  Example:

  ```javascript
  // Example usage (React project using React SDK)
  void signIn({
    redirectUri,
    loginHint: "user@example.com",
    firstScreen: "signIn", // or 'register'
  });
  ```

## 1.19.0

### Minor Changes

- 6477c6dee: add `custom_data` to applications

  Introduce a new property `custom_data` to the `Application` schema. This property is an arbitrary object that can be used to store custom data for an application.

  Added a new API to update the custom data of an application:

  - `PATCH /applications/:applicationId/custom-data`

- d203c8d2f: support experience data server-side rendering

  Logto now injects the sign-in experience settings and phrases into the `index.html` file for better first-screen performance. The experience app will still fetch the settings and phrases from the server if:

  - The server didn't inject the settings and phrases.
  - The parameters in the URL are different from server-rendered data.

- b188bb161: support multiple app secrets with expiration

  Now secure apps (machine-to-machine, traditional web, Protected) can have multiple app secrets with expiration. This allows for secret rotation and provides an even safer experience.

  To manage your application secrets, go to Logto Console -> Applications -> Application Details -> Endpoints & Credentials.

  We've also added a set of Management APIs (`/api/applications/{id}/secrets`) for this purpose.

  > [!Important]
  > You can still use existing app secrets for client authentication, but it is recommended to delete the old ones and create new secrets with expiration for enhanced security.

- 62f5e5e0c: support dark favicon

  The favicon for the dark theme now can be set in the sign-in experience branding settings.

- d56bc2f73: add support for new password digest algorithm argon2d and argon2id

  In `POST /users`, the `passwordAlgorithm` field now accepts `Argon2d` and `Argon2id`.

  Users with those algorithms will be migrated to `Argon2i` upon succussful sign in.

- 510f681fa: use tsup for building

  We've updated some of the packages to use `tsup` for building. This will make the build process faster, and should not affect the functionality of the packages.

  Use minor version bump to catch your attention.

### Patch Changes

- 3a839f6d6: support organization logo and sign-in experience override

  Now it's able to set light and dark logos for organizations. You can upload the logos in the organization settings page.

  Also, it's possible to override the sign-in experience logo from an organization. Simply add the `organization_id` parameter to the authentication request. In most Logto SDKs, it can be done by using the `extraParams` field in the `signIn` method.

  For example, in the JavaScript SDK:

  ```ts
  import LogtoClient from "@logto/client";

  const logtoClient = new LogtoClient(/* your configuration */);

  logtoClient.signIn({
    redirectUri: "https://your-app.com/callback",
    extraParams: {
      organization_id: "<organization-id>",
    },
  });
  ```

  The value `<organization-id>` can be found in the organization settings page.

  If you could not find the `extraParams` field in the SDK you are using, please let us know.

## 1.18.0

### Minor Changes

- 87615d58c: support machine-to-machine apps for organizations

  This feature allows machine-to-machine apps to be associated with organizations, and be assigned with organization roles.

  ### Console

  - Add a new "machine-to-machine" type to organization roles. All existing roles are now "user" type.
  - You can manage machine-to-machine apps in the organization details page -> Machine-to-machine apps section.
  - You can view the associated organizations in the machine-to-machine app details page.

  ### OpenID Connect grant

  The `client_credentials` grant type is now supported for organizations. You can use this grant type to obtain an access token for an organization.

  ### Management API

  A set of new endpoints are added to the Management API:

  - `/api/organizations/{id}/applications` to manage machine-to-machine apps.
  - `/api/organizations/{id}/applications/{applicationId}` to manage a specific machine-to-machine app in an organization.
  - `/api/applications/{id}/organizations` to view the associated organizations of a machine-to-machine app.

- 061a30a87: support agree to terms polices for Logto’s sign-in experiences

  - Automatic: Users automatically agree to terms by continuing to use the service
  - ManualRegistrationOnly: Users must agree to terms by checking a box during registration, and don't need to agree when signing in
  - Manual: Users must agree to terms by checking a box during registration or signing in

- ef21c7a99: support per-organization multi-factor authentication requirement

  An organization can now require its member to have multi-factor authentication (MFA) configured. If an organization has this requirement and a member does not have MFA configured, the member will not be able to fetch the organization access token.

- b52609a1e: add `hasPassword` to custom JWT user context
- efa884c40: feature: just-in-time user provisioning for organizations

  This feature allows users to automatically join the organization and be assigned roles upon their first sign-in through some authentication methods. You can set requirements to meet for just-in-time provisioning.

  ### Email domains

  New users will automatically join organizations with just-in-time provisioning if they:

  - Sign up with verified email addresses, or;
  - Use social sign-in with verified email addresses.

  This applies to organizations that have the same email domain configured.

  To enable this feature, you can add email domain via the Management API or the Logto Console:

  - We added the following new endpoints to the Management API:
    - `GET /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/email-domains`
    - `POST /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/email-domains`
    - `PUT /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/email-domains`
    - `DELETE /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/email-domains/{emailDomain}`
  - In the Logto Console, you can manage email domains in the organization details page -> "Just-in-time provisioning" section.

  ### SSO connectors

  New or existing users signing in through enterprise SSO for the first time will automatically join organizations that have just-in-time provisioning configured for the SSO connector.

  To enable this feature, you can add SSO connectors via the Management API or the Logto Console:

  - We added the following new endpoints to the Management API:
    - `GET /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/sso-connectors`
    - `POST /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/sso-connectors`
    - `PUT /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/sso-connectors`
    - `DELETE /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/sso-connectors/{ssoConnectorId}`
  - In the Logto Console, you can manage SSO connectors in the organization details page -> "Just-in-time provisioning" section.

  ### Default organization roles

  You can also configure the default roles for users provisioned via this feature. The default roles will be assigned to the user when they are provisioned.

  To enable this feature, you can set the default roles via the Management API or the Logto Console:

  - We added the following new endpoints to the Management API:
    - `GET /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/roles`
    - `POST /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/roles`
    - `PUT /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/roles`
    - `DELETE /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/roles/{organizationRoleId}`
  - In the Logto Console, you can manage default roles in the organization details page -> "Just-in-time provisioning" section.

- b50ba0b7e: enable backchannel logout support

  Enable the support of [OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0.html).

  To register for backchannel logout, navigate to the application details page in the Logto Console and locate the "Backchannel logout" section. Enter the backchannel logout URL of your RP and click "Save".

  You can also enable session requirements for backchannel logout. When enabled, Logto will include the `sid` claim in the logout token.

  For programmatic registration, you can set the `backchannelLogoutUri` and `backchannelLogoutSessionRequired` properties in the application `oidcClientMetadata` object.

### Minor Changes

- abffb9f95: full oidc standard claims support

  We have added support for the remaining [OpenID Connect standard claims](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims). Now, these claims are accessible in both ID tokens and the response from the `/me` endpoint.

  Additionally, we adhere to the standard scopes - claims mapping. This means that you can retrieve most of the profile claims using the `profile` scope, and the `address` claim can be obtained by using the `address` scope.

  For all newly introduced claims, we store them in the `user.profile` field.

  > ![Note]
  > Unlike other database fields (e.g. `name`), the claims stored in the `profile` field will fall back to `undefined` rather than `null`. We refrain from using `?? null` here to reduce the size of ID tokens, since `undefined` fields will be stripped in tokens.

- 2cbc591ff: add oidc params variables and types

  - Add `ExtraParamsKey` enum for all possible OIDC extra parameters that Logto supports.
  - Add `FirstScreen` enum for the `first_screen` parameter.
  - Add `extraParamsObjectGuard` guard and `ExtraParamsObject` type for shaping the extra parameters object in the OIDC authentication request.

### Patch Changes

- 951865859: ## Resolve third-party app's /interaction/consent endpoint 500 error

  ### Reproduction steps

  - Create an organization scope with an empty description and assign this scope to a third-party application.
  - Login to the third-party application and request the organization scope.
  - Proceed through the interaction flow until reaching the consent page.
  - An internal server error 500 is returned.

  ### Root cause

  For the `/interaction/consent` endpoint, the organization scope is returned alongside other resource scopes in the `missingResourceScopes` property.

  In the `consentInfoResponseGuard`, we utilize the resource Scopes zod guard to validate the `missingResourceScopes` property. However, the description field in the resource scope is mandatory while organization scopes'description is optional. An organization scope with an empty description will not pass the validation.

  ### Solution

  Alter the resource scopes table to make the description field nullable. Related Scope zod guard and the consentInfoResponseGuard will be updated to reflect this change. Align the resource scopes table with the organization scopes table to ensure consistency.

- 6727f629d: feature: introduce multi-factor authentication

  We're excited to announce that Logto now supports multi-factor authentication (MFA) for your sign-in experience. Navigate to the "Multi-factor auth" tab to configure how you want to secure your users' accounts.

  In this release, we introduce the following MFA methods:

  - Authenticator app OTP: users can add any authenticator app that supports the TOTP standard, such as Google Authenticator, Duo, etc.
  - WebAuthn (Passkey): users can use the standard WebAuthn protocol to register a hardware security key, such as biometric keys, Yubikey, etc.
  - Backup codes：users can generate a set of backup codes to use when they don't have access to other MFA methods.

  For a smooth transition, we also support to configure the MFA policy to require MFA for sign-in experience, or to allow users to opt-in to MFA.

### Minor Changes

- e8b0b1d02: feature: password policy

  ### Summary

  This feature enables custom password policy for users. Now it is possible to guard with the following rules when a user is creating a new password:

  - Minimum length (default: `8`)
  - Minimum character types (default: `1`)
  - If the password has been pwned (default: `true`)
  - If the password is exactly the same as or made up of the restricted phrases:
    - Repetitive or sequential characters (default: `true`)
    - User information (default: `true`)
    - Custom words (default: `[]`)

  If you are an existing Logto Cloud user or upgrading from a previous version, to ensure a smooth experience, we'll keep the original policy as much as possible:

  > The original password policy requires a minimum length of 8 and at least 2 character types (letters, numbers, and symbols).

  Note in the new policy implementation, it is not possible to combine lower and upper case letters into one character type. So the original password policy will be translated into the following:

  - Minimum length: `8`
  - Minimum character types: `2`
  - Pwned: `false`
  - Repetitive or sequential characters: `false`
  - User information: `false`
  - Custom words: `[]`

  If you want to change the policy, you can do it:

  - Logto Console -> Sign-in experience -> Password policy.
  - Update `passwordPolicy` property in the sign-in experience via Management API.

  ### Side effects

  - All new users will be affected by the new policy immediately.
  - Existing users will not be affected by the new policy until they change their password.
  - We removed password restrictions when adding or updating a user via Management API.

- 17fd64e64: Support region option for s3 storage
- 5d78c7271: Add `type` field to `roles` schema.

  `type` can be either 'User' or 'MachineToMachine' in our case, this change distinguish between the two types of roles.
  Roles with type 'MachineToMachine' are not allowed to be assigned to users and 'User' roles can not be assigned to machine-to-machine apps.
  It's worth noting that we do not differentiate by `scope` (or `permission` in Admin Console), so a scope can be assigned to both the 'User' role and the 'MachineToMachine' role simultaneously.

### Major Changes

- c12717412: **Decouple users and admins**

  ## 💥 BREAKING CHANGES 💥

  Logto was using a single port to serve both normal users and admins, as well as the web console. While we continuously maintain a high level of security, it’ll still be great to decouple these components into two separate parts to keep data isolated and provide a flexible infrastructure.

  From this version, Logto now listens to two ports by default, one for normal users (`3001`), and one for admins (`3002`).

  - Nothing changed for normal users. No adaption is needed.
  - For admin users:
    - The default Admin Console URL has been changed to `http://localhost:3002/console`.
    - To change the admin port, set the environment variable `ADMIN_PORT`. For instance, `ADMIN_PORT=3456`.
    - You can specify a custom endpoint for admins by setting the environment variable `ADMIN_ENDPOINT`. For example, `ADMIN_ENDPOINT=https://admin.your-domain.com`.
    - You can now completely disable admin endpoints by setting `ADMIN_DISABLE_LOCALHOST=1` and leaving `ADMIN_ENDPOINT` unset.
    - Admin Console and admin user data are not accessible via normal user endpoints, including `localhost` and `ENDPOINT` from the environment.
    - Admin Console no longer displays audit logs of admin users. However, these logs still exist in the database, and Logto still inserts admin user logs. There is just no convenient interface to inspect them.
    - Due to the data isolation, the numbers on the dashboard may slightly decrease (admins are excluded).

  If you are upgrading from a previous version, simply run the database alteration command as usual, and we'll take care of the rest.

  > **Note** DID YOU KNOW
  >
  > Under the hood, we use the powerful Postgres feature Row-Level Security to isolate admin and user data.

- 1c9160112: Packages are now ESM.
- f41fd3f05: drop settings table and add systems table

  **BREAKING CHANGES**

  - core: removed `GET /settings` and `PATCH /settings` API
  - core: added `GET /configs/admin-console` and `PATCH /configs/admin-console` API
    - `/configs/*` APIs are config/key-specific now. they may have different logic per key
  - cli: change valid `logto db config` keys by removing `alterationState` and adding `adminConsole` since:
    - OIDC configs and admin console configs are tenant-level configs (the concept of "tenant" can be ignored until we officially announce it)
    - alteration state is still a system-wide config

### Minor Changes

- 343b1090f: Add demo social connectors for new tenant
- f41fd3f05: Replace `passcode` naming convention in the interaction APIs and main flow ui with `verificationCode`.

### Major Changes

- c12717412: **Decouple users and admins**

  ## 💥 BREAKING CHANGES 💥

  Logto was using a single port to serve both normal users and admins, as well as the web console. While we continuously maintain a high level of security, it’ll still be great to decouple these components into two separate parts to keep data isolated and provide a flexible infrastructure.

  From this version, Logto now listens to two ports by default, one for normal users (`3001`), and one for admins (`3002`).

  - Nothing changed for normal users. No adaption is needed.
  - For admin users:
    - The default Admin Console URL has been changed to `http://localhost:3002/console`.
    - To change the admin port, set the environment variable `ADMIN_PORT`. For instance, `ADMIN_PORT=3456`.
    - You can specify a custom endpoint for admins by setting the environment variable `ADMIN_ENDPOINT`. For example, `ADMIN_ENDPOINT=https://admin.your-domain.com`.
    - You can now completely disable admin endpoints by setting `ADMIN_DISABLE_LOCALHOST=1` and leaving `ADMIN_ENDPOINT` unset.
    - Admin Console and admin user data are not accessible via normal user endpoints, including `localhost` and `ENDPOINT` from the environment.
    - Admin Console no longer displays audit logs of admin users. However, these logs still exist in the database, and Logto still inserts admin user logs. There is just no convenient interface to inspect them.
    - Due to the data isolation, the numbers on the dashboard may slightly decrease (admins are excluded).

  If you are upgrading from a previous version, simply run the database alteration command as usual, and we'll take care of the rest.

  > **Note** DID YOU KNOW
  >
  > Under the hood, we use the powerful Postgres feature Row-Level Security to isolate admin and user data.

## 1.0.0-rc.0

### Major Changes

- f41fd3f0: drop settings table and add systems table

  **BREAKING CHANGES**

  - core: removed `GET /settings` and `PATCH /settings` API
  - core: added `GET /configs/admin-console` and `PATCH /configs/admin-console` API
    - `/configs/*` APIs are config/key-specific now. they may have different logic per key
  - cli: change valid `logto db config` keys by removing `alterationState` and adding `adminConsole` since:
    - OIDC configs and admin console configs are tenant-level configs (the concept of "tenant" can be ignored until we officially announce it)
    - alteration state is still a system-wide config

### Minor Changes

- f41fd3f0: Replace `passcode` naming convention in the interaction APIs and main flow ui with `verificationCode`.
- f41fd3f0: Replace the `sms` naming convention using `phone` cross logto codebase. Including Sign-in Experience types, API paths, API payload and internal variable names.
