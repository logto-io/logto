# Integrate Logto Swift SDK for iOS

:::note
This tutorial assumes you have created a Native App in Admin Console. If you are not ready, read this one before continuing.
:::

## Add Logto SDK as a Dependency

Use the following URL to add Logto SDK as a dependency in Swift Package Manager.

```bash
https://github.com/logto-io/swift.git
```

Since Xcode 11, you can [directly import a swift package](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app) w/o any additional tool.

We do not support **Carthage** and **CocoaPods** at the time due to some technical issues.

<details>
  <summary>Carthage</summary>
  Carthage <a href="https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/issues/1226#issuecomment-290931385">needs a `xcodeproj` file to build</a>, but `swift package generate-xcodeproj` will report a failure since we are using binary targets for native social plugins. We will try to find a workaround later.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>CocoaPods</summary>
  CocoaPods <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/3276">does not support local dependency</a> and monorepo, thus it's hard to create a `.podspec` for this repo.
</details>

## Init `LogtoClient`

```swift
import Logto

let config = try? LogtoConfig(
  endpoint: "<your-logto-endpoint>",
  appId: "<your-application-id>"
)
let logtoClient = LogtoClient(useConfig: config)
```

By default, we store credentials like ID Token and Refresh Token in Keychain. Thus the user doesn't need to sign in again when he returns.

To turn off this behavior, set `usingPersistStorage` to `false`:

```swift
let config = try? LogtoConfig(
  // ...
  usingPersistStorage: false
)
```

## Sign In

:::note
Before calling `.signInWithBrowser(redirectUri:)`, make sure you have correctly [configured Redirect URI](https://logto.io) in Admin Console.
:::

```swift
do {
  try await client.signInWithBrowser(redirectUri: "<your-redirect-uri>")
  print(client.isAuthenticated) // true
} catch let error as LogtoClientErrors.SignIn {
  // error occured during sign in
}
```

## Sign Out

```swift
await client.signOut()
```

This will clean all the Logto data in Keychain, if it has.
