- 13d04d776: feat: support multiple sign-up identifiers in sign-in experience

  ## New update

  Introduces a new optional field, `secondaryIdentifiers`, to the sign-in experience sign-up settings. This enhancement allows developers to specify multiple required user identifiers during the user sign-up process. Available options include `email`, `phone`, `username` and `emailOrPhone`.

  ### Explanation of the difference between `signUp.identifiers` and new `signUp.secondaryIdentifiers`

  The existing `signUp.identifiers` field represents the sign-up identifiers enabled for user sign-up and is an array type. In this legacy setup, if multiple identifiers are provided, users can complete the sign-up process using any one of them. The only multi-value case allowed is `[email, phone]`, which signifies that users can provide either an email or a phone number.

  To enhance flexibility and support multiple required sign-up identifiers, the existing `signUp.identifiers` field does not suffice. To maintain backward compatibility with existing data, we have introduced this new `secondaryIdentifiers` field.

  Unlike the `signUp.identifiers` field, the `signUp.secondaryIdentifiers` array follows an `AND` logic, meaning that all elements listed in this field are required during the sign-up process, in addition to the primary identifiers. This new field also accommodates the `emailOrPhone` case by defining an exclusive `emailOrPhone` value type, which indicates that either a phone number or an email address must be provided.

  In summary, while `identifiers` allows for optional selection among email and phone, `secondaryIdentifiers` enforces mandatory inclusion of all specified identifiers.

  ### Examples

  1. `username` as the primary identifier. In addition, user will be required to provide a verified `email` and `phone number` during the sign-up process.

  ```json
  {
    "identifiers": ["username"],
    "secondaryIdentifiers": [
      {
        "type": "email",
        "verify": true
      },
      {
        "type": "phone",
        "verify": true
      }
    ],
    "verify": true,
    "password": true
  }
  ```

  2. `username` as the primary identifier. In addition, user will be required to provide either a verified `email` or `phone number` during the sign-up process.

  ```json
  {
    "identifiers": ["username"],
    "secondaryIdentifiers": [
      {
        "type": "emailOrPhone",
        "verify": true
      }
    ],
    "verify": true,
    "password": true
  }
  ```

  3. `email` or `phone number` as the primary identifier. In addition, user will be required to provide a `username` during the sign-up process.

  ```json
  {
    "identifiers": ["email", "phone"],
    "secondaryIdentifiers": [
      {
        "type": "username",
        "verify": true
      }
    ],
    "verify": true,
    "password": false
  }
  ```

  ### Sign-in experience settings

  - `@logto/core`: Update the `/api/sign-in-experience` endpoint to support the new `secondaryIdentifiers` field in the sign-up settings.
  - `@logto/console`: Replace the sign-up identifier single selector with a multi-selector to support multiple sign-up identifiers. The order of the identifiers can be rearranged by dragging and dropping the items in the list. The first item in the list will be considered the primary identifier and stored in the `signUp.identifiers` field, while the rest will be stored in the `signUp.secondaryIdentifiers` field.

  ### End-user experience

  The sign-up flow is now split into two stages:

  - Primary identifiers (`signUp.identifiers`) are collected in the first-screen registration screen.
  - Secondary identifiers (`signUp.secondaryIdentifiers`) are requested in subsequent steps after the primary registration has been submitted.

  ## Other refactors

  We have fully decoupled the sign-up identifier settings from the sign-in methods. Developers can now require as many user identifiers as needed during the sign-up process without impacting the sign-in process.

  The following restrictions on sign-in and sign-up settings have been removed:

  1. Password requirement is now optional when `username` is configured as a sign-up identifier. However, users without passwords cannot sign in using username authentication.
  2. Removed the constraint requiring sign-up identifiers to be enabled as sign-in methods.
  3. Removed the requirement for password verification across all sign-in methods when password is enabled for sign-up.

## 1.20.0

### Minor Changes

- f1b1d9e95: new MFA prompt policy

  You can now cutomize the MFA prompt policy in the Console.

  First, choose if you want to enable **Require MFA**:

  - **Enable**: Users will be prompted to set up MFA during the sign-in process which cannot be skipped. If the user fails to set up MFA or deletes their MFA settings, they will be locked out of their account until they set up MFA again.
  - **Disable**: Users can skip the MFA setup process during sign-up flow.

  If you choose to **Disable**, you can choose the MFA setup prompt:

  - Do not ask users to set up MFA.
  - Ask users to set up MFA during registration (skippable, one-time prompt). **The same prompt as previous policy (UserControlled)**
  - Ask users to set up MFA on their sign-in after registration (skippable, one-time prompt)

### Patch Changes

- 239b81e31: loose redirect uri restrictions

  Logto has been following the industry best practices for OAuth2.0 and OIDC from the start. However, in the real world, there are things we cannot control, like third-party services or operation systems like Windows.

  This update relaxes restrictions on redirect URIs to allow the following:

  1. A mix of native and HTTP(S) redirect URIs. For example, a native app can now use a redirect URI like `https://example.com`.
  2. Native schemes without a period (`.`). For example, `myapp://callback` is now allowed.

  When such URIs are configured, Logto Console will display a prominent warning. This change is backward-compatible and will not affect existing applications.

  We hope this change will make it easier for you to integrate Logto with your applications.

## 1.19.0

### Minor Changes

- 640425414: add `trustUnverifiedEmail` setting for the Microsoft EntraID OIDC SSO connector

  Since we launched the **EntraID OIDC SSO connector** we have received several feedbacks that their customer's email address can not be populated to Logto's user profile when signing up through the EntraID OIDC SSO connector.
  This is because Logto only syncs verified email addresses, meaning the `email_verified` claim must be `true` in the user info response from the OIDC provider.

  However, based on Microsoft's documentation, since the user's email address in manually managed by the organization, they are not verified guaranteed. This means that the `email_verified` claim will not be included in their user info response.

  To address this issue, we have added a new `trustUnverifiedEmail` exclusively for the Microsoft EntraID OIDC SSO connector. When this setting is enabled, Logto will trust the email address provided by the Microsoft EntraID OIDC SSO connector even if the `email_verified` claim is not included in the user info response. This will allow users to sign up and log in to Logto using their email address without any issues. Please note this may introduce a security risk as the email address is not verified by the OIDC provider. You should only enable this setting if you trust the email address provided by the Microsoft EntraID OIDC SSO connector.

  You can configure this setting in the **EntraID OIDC SSO connector** settings page in the Logto console or through the management API.

- 640425414: display support email and website info on experience error pages.

  Added support email and website info to the error pages of the experience app. E.g. when a user tries to access a page that doesn't exist, or when the social session is not found in a social callback page. This will help users to contact support easily when they encounter an error.

  You may configure the support email and website info in the sign-in experience settings page in the Logto console or through the management API.

- 640425414: add unknown session redirect url in the sign-in experience settings

  In certain cases, Logto may be unable to properly identify a user’s authentication session when they land on the sign-in page. This can happen if the session has expired, if the user bookmarks the sign-in URL for future access, or if they directly share the sign-in link. By default, an "unknown session" 404 error is displayed.

  To improve user experience, we have added a new `unknownSessionRedirectUrl` field in the sign-in experience settings.You can configure this field to redirect users to a custom URL when an unknown session is detected. This will help users to easily navigate to your client application or website and reinitiate the authentication process automatically.

## 1.18.0

### Minor Changes

- f150a67d5: display user password information on user details page
- e0326c96c: Add personal access token (PAT)

  Personal access tokens (PATs) provide a secure way for users to grant access tokens without using their credentials and interactive sign-in.

  You can create a PAT by going to the user's detail page in Console or using the Management API `POST /users/:userId/personal-access-tokens`.

  To use a PAT, call the token exchange endpoint `POST /oidc/token` with the following parameters:

  1. `grant_type`: REQUIRED. The value of this parameter must be `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange` indicates that a token exchange is being performed.
  2. `resource`: OPTIONAL. The resource indicator, the same as other token requests.
  3. `scope`: OPTIONAL. The requested scopes, the same as other token requests.
  4. `subject_token`: REQUIRED. The user's PAT.
  5. `subject_token_type`: REQUIRED. The type of the security token provided in the `subject_token` parameter. The value of this parameter must be `urn:logto:token-type:personal_access_token`.
  6. `client_id`: REQUIRED. The client identifier of the client application that is making the request, the returned access token will contain this client_id claim.

  And the response will be a JSON object with the following properties:

  1. `access_token`: REQUIRED. The access token of the user, which is the same as other token requests like `authorization_code` or `refresh_token`.
  2. `issued_token_type`: REQUIRED. The type of the issued token. The value of this parameter must be `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token`.
  3. `token_type`: REQUIRED. The type of the token. The value of this parameter must be `Bearer`.
  4. `expires_in`: REQUIRED. The lifetime in seconds of the access token.
  5. `scope`: OPTIONAL. The scopes of the access token.

- b837efead: add access deny method to the custom token claims script

  Introduce a new `api` parameter to the custom token claims script. This parameter is used to provide more access control context over the token exchange process.
  Use `api.denyAccess()` to reject the token exchange request. Use this method to implement your own access control logics.

  ```javascript
  const getCustomJwtClaims: async ({ api }) => {
    // Reject the token request, with a custom error message
    return api.denyAccess('Access denied');
  }
  ```

### Patch Changes

## 1.17.0

### Minor Changes

- 3a839f6d6: support organization logo and sign-in experience override

  Now it's able to set light and dark logos for organizations. You can upload the logos in the organization settings page.

  Also, it's possible to override the sign-in experience logo from an organization. Simply add the `organization_id` parameter to the authentication request. In most Logto SDKs, it can be done by using the `extraParams` field in the `signIn` method.

  For example, in the JavaScript SDK:

  ```ts
  import LogtoClient from "@logto/client";

  const logtoClient = new LogtoClient(/* your configuration */);

  logtoClient.signIn({
    redirectUri: "https://your-app.com/callback",
    extraParams: {
      organization_id: "<organization-id>",
    },
  });
  ```

  The value `<organization-id>` can be found in the organization settings page.

  If you could not find the `extraParams` field in the SDK you are using, please let us know.

- b91ec0cd6: add the application `custom_data` field editor to the application details page in console
- 62f5e5e0c: support app-level branding

  You can now set logos, favicons, and colors for your app. These settings will be used in the sign-in experience when the app initiates the authentication flow. For apps that have no branding settings, the omni sign-in experience branding will be used.

  If `organization_id` is provided in the authentication request, the app-level branding settings will be overridden by the organization's branding settings, if available.

- 3bf756f2b: use Vite for transpilation and bundling

  Removed ParcelJS and replaced with Vite. No breaking changes should be expected, but use a minor version bump to catch your attention.

  > [!Important]
  > The browserlist configuration for `@logto/experience` and been synced with what is stated in README.md.

- b188bb161: support multiple app secrets with expiration

  Now secure apps (machine-to-machine, traditional web, Protected) can have multiple app secrets with expiration. This allows for secret rotation and provides an even safer experience.

  To manage your application secrets, go to Logto Console -> Applications -> Application Details -> Endpoints & Credentials.

  We've also added a set of Management APIs (`/api/applications/{id}/secrets`) for this purpose.

  > [!Important]
  > You can still use existing app secrets for client authentication, but it is recommended to delete the old ones and create new secrets with expiration for enhanced security.

- 62f5e5e0c: support dark favicon

  The favicon for the dark theme now can be set in the sign-in experience branding settings.

  - You can manage machine-to-machine apps in the organization details page -> Machine-to-machine apps section.
  - You can view the associated organizations in the machine-to-machine app details page.

  ### OpenID Connect grant

  The `client_credentials` grant type is now supported for organizations. You can use this grant type to obtain an access token for an organization.

  ### Management API

  A set of new endpoints are added to the Management API:

  - `/api/organizations/{id}/applications` to manage machine-to-machine apps.
  - `/api/organizations/{id}/applications/{applicationId}` to manage a specific machine-to-machine app in an organization.
  - `/api/applications/{id}/organizations` to view the associated organizations of a machine-to-machine app.

- ead51e555: add Ruby app guide
- ef21c7a99: support per-organization multi-factor authentication requirement

  An organization can now require its member to have multi-factor authentication (MFA) configured. If an organization has this requirement and a member does not have MFA configured, the member will not be able to fetch the organization access token.

- 0ef712e4e: support Google One Tap configuration
- 15953609b: support the dynamic config rendering for connector multi-select configuration
- b52609a1e: add `hasPassword` to custom JWT user context
- efa884c40: feature: just-in-time user provisioning for organizations

  This feature allows users to automatically join the organization and be assigned roles upon their first sign-in through some authentication methods. You can set requirements to meet for just-in-time provisioning.

  ### Email domains

  New users will automatically join organizations with just-in-time provisioning if they:

  - Sign up with verified email addresses, or;
  - Use social sign-in with verified email addresses.

  This applies to organizations that have the same email domain configured.

  To enable this feature, you can add email domain via the Management API or the Logto Console:

  - We added the following new endpoints to the Management API:
    - `GET /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/email-domains`
    - `POST /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/email-domains`
    - `PUT /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/email-domains`
    - `DELETE /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/email-domains/{emailDomain}`
  - In the Logto Console, you can manage email domains in the organization details page -> "Just-in-time provisioning" section.

  ### SSO connectors

  New or existing users signing in through enterprise SSO for the first time will automatically join organizations that have just-in-time provisioning configured for the SSO connector.

  To enable this feature, you can add SSO connectors via the Management API or the Logto Console:

  - We added the following new endpoints to the Management API:
    - `GET /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/sso-connectors`
    - `POST /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/sso-connectors`
    - `PUT /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/sso-connectors`
    - `DELETE /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/sso-connectors/{ssoConnectorId}`
  - In the Logto Console, you can manage SSO connectors in the organization details page -> "Just-in-time provisioning" section.

  ### Default organization roles

  You can also configure the default roles for users provisioned via this feature. The default roles will be assigned to the user when they are provisioned.

  To enable this feature, you can set the default roles via the Management API or the Logto Console:

  - We added the following new endpoints to the Management API:
    - `GET /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/roles`
    - `POST /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/roles`
    - `PUT /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/roles`
    - `DELETE /organizations/{organizationId}/jit/roles/{organizationRoleId}`
  - In the Logto Console, you can manage default roles in the organization details page -> "Just-in-time provisioning" section.

- b50ba0b7e: enable backchannel logout support

  Enable the support of [OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0.html).

  To register for backchannel logout, navigate to the application details page in the Logto Console and locate the "Backchannel logout" section. Enter the backchannel logout URL of your RP and click "Save".

  You can also enable session requirements for backchannel logout. When enabled, Logto will include the `sid` claim in the logout token.

  For programmatic registration, you can set the `backchannelLogoutUri` and `backchannelLogoutSessionRequired` properties in the application `oidcClientMetadata` object.

### Patch Changes

- 9f33d997b: view and update user's `profile` property in the user settings page
- 06ef19905: fix a regression bug that error toasts pop up in audit log when logs are associated with deleted applications
- af44e87eb: add Chrome extension guide
- 136320584: allow skipping manual account linking during sign-in

  You can find this configuration in Console -> Sign-in experience -> Sign-up and sign-in -> Social sign-in -> Automatic account linking.

  When switched on, if a user signs in with a social identity that is new to the system, and there is exactly one existing account with the same identifier (e.g., email), Logto will automatically link the account with the social identity instead of prompting the user for account linking.

- d81e13d21: display OIDC issuer endpoint in the application details form

  ## Updates

  - Separated the "Organization template" from the "Organization" page, establishing it as a standalone page for clearer navigation and functionality.
  - Enhanced the "Organization template" page by adding functionality that allows users to click on an organization role, which then navigates to the organization role details page where users can view its corresponding permissions and general settings.
  - Enabled the assignment of API resource permissions directly from the organization role details page, improving role management and access control.
  - Split the permission list for third-party apps into two separate lists: user permissions and organization permissions. Users can now add user profile permissions and API resource permissions for users under user permissions, and add organization permissions and API resource permissions for organizations under organization permissions.

- becf59169: introduce Logto Organizations

  The term "organization" is also used in other forms, such as "workspace", "team", "company", etc. In Logto, we use "organization" as the generic term to represent the concept of multi-tenancy.

  From now, you can create multiple organizations in Logto, each of which can have its own users, while in the same identity pool.

  Plus, we also introduce the concept of "organization template". It is a set of permissions and roles that applies to all organizations, while a user can have different roles in different organizations.

  See [🏢 Organizations (Multi-tenancy)](https://docs.logto.io/docs/recipes/organizations/) for more details.

## 1.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 6727f629d: feature: introduce multi-factor authentication

  We're excited to announce that Logto now supports multi-factor authentication (MFA) for your sign-in experience. Navigate to the "Multi-factor auth" tab to configure how you want to secure your users' accounts.

  In this release, we introduce the following MFA methods:

  - Authenticator app OTP: users can add any authenticator app that supports the TOTP standard, such as Google Authenticator, Duo, etc.
  - WebAuthn (Passkey): users can use the standard WebAuthn protocol to register a hardware security key, such as biometric keys, Yubikey, etc.
  - Backup codes：users can generate a set of backup codes to use when they don't have access to other MFA methods.

  For a smooth transition, we also support to configure the MFA policy to require MFA for sign-in experience, or to allow users to opt-in to MFA.

## 1.8.0

### Minor Changes

- a8b5a020f: feature: machine-to-machine (M2M) role-based access control (RBAC)

  ### Summary

  This feature enables Logto users to apply role-based access control (RBAC) to their machine-to-machine (M2M) applications.

  With the update, Logto users can now effectively manage permissions for their M2M applications, resulting in improved security and flexibility.

  #### New role type: machine-to-machine

  We have introduced a new role type, "machine-to-machine".

  - When creating a new role, you can select the type (either "machine-to-machine" or "user" type), with "user" type by default if not specified.
  - Logto now ONLY allows the selection of the role type during role creation.

  #### Manage "machine-to-machine" roles

  You can manage the permissions of a "machine-to-machine" role in the same way as a "user" role.

  > Logto's management API resources are available to "machine-to-machine" roles but not for "user" roles.
  > "machine-to-machine" roles can only be assigned to M2M applications; and "user" roles can only be assigned to users.

  You can assign "machine-to-machine" roles to M2M applications in the following two ways:

  - "Applications" on sidebar -> Select an M2M application -> "Roles" tab -> "Assign Roles" button
  - "Roles" on sidebar -> Select an M2M role -> "Machine-to-machine apps" tab -> "Assign Applications" button

### Patch Changes

- 18181f892: standardize id and secret generators

  - Add `generateStandardSecret` and `generateStandardShortId` exports to `@logto/shared`
  - Align comment and implementation of `buildIdGenerator` in `@logto/shared`
    - The comment stated the function will include uppercase letters by default, but it did not; Now it does.
  - Use `generateStandardSecret` for all secret generation

## 1.7.1

### Patch Changes

- a4b44dde5: add more intuitive code samples and fix mistakes in express api guide

## 1.7.0

### Minor Changes

- e8b0b1d02: feature: password policy

  ### Summary

  This feature enables custom password policy for users. Now it is possible to guard with the following rules when a user is creating a new password:

  - Minimum length (default: `8`)
  - Minimum character types (default: `1`)
  - If the password has been pwned (default: `true`)
  - If the password is exactly the same as or made up of the restricted phrases:
    - Repetitive or sequential characters (default: `true`)
    - User information (default: `true`)
    - Custom words (default: `[]`)

  If you are an existing Logto Cloud user or upgrading from a previous version, to ensure a smooth experience, we'll keep the original policy as much as possible:

  > The original password policy requires a minimum length of 8 and at least 2 character types (letters, numbers, and symbols).

  Note in the new policy implementation, it is not possible to combine lower and upper case letters into one character type. So the original password policy will be translated into the following:

  - Minimum length: `8`
  - Minimum character types: `2`
  - Pwned: `false`
  - Repetitive or sequential characters: `false`
  - User information: `false`
  - Custom words: `[]`

  If you want to change the policy, you can do it:

  - Logto Console -> Sign-in experience -> Password policy.
  - Update `passwordPolicy` property in the sign-in experience via Management API.

  ### Side effects

  - All new users will be affected by the new policy immediately.
  - Existing users will not be affected by the new policy until they change their password.
  - We removed password restrictions when adding or updating a user via Management API.

### Patch Changes

- f8408fa77: rename the package `phrases-ui` to `phrases-experience`

### Major Changes

- c12717412: **Decouple users and admins**

  ## 💥 BREAKING CHANGES 💥

  Logto was using a single port to serve both normal users and admins, as well as the web console. While we continuously maintain a high level of security, it’ll still be great to decouple these components into two separate parts to keep data isolated and provide a flexible infrastructure.

  From this version, Logto now listens to two ports by default, one for normal users (`3001`), and one for admins (`3002`).

  - Nothing changed for normal users. No adaption is needed.
  - For admin users:
    - The default Admin Console URL has been changed to `http://localhost:3002/console`.
    - To change the admin port, set the environment variable `ADMIN_PORT`. For instance, `ADMIN_PORT=3456`.
    - You can specify a custom endpoint for admins by setting the environment variable `ADMIN_ENDPOINT`. For example, `ADMIN_ENDPOINT=https://admin.your-domain.com`.
    - You can now completely disable admin endpoints by setting `ADMIN_DISABLE_LOCALHOST=1` and leaving `ADMIN_ENDPOINT` unset.
    - Admin Console and admin user data are not accessible via normal user endpoints, including `localhost` and `ENDPOINT` from the environment.
    - Admin Console no longer displays audit logs of admin users. However, these logs still exist in the database, and Logto still inserts admin user logs. There is just no convenient interface to inspect them.
    - Due to the data isolation, the numbers on the dashboard may slightly decrease (admins are excluded).

  If you are upgrading from a previous version, simply run the database alteration command as usual, and we'll take care of the rest.

  > **Note** DID YOU KNOW
  >
  > Under the hood, we use the powerful Postgres feature Row-Level Security to isolate admin and user data.

- 1c9160112: ### Features

  - Enhanced user search params #2639

- f41fd3f05: drop settings table and add systems table

  **BREAKING CHANGES**

  - core: removed `GET /settings` and `PATCH /settings` API
  - core: added `GET /configs/admin-console` and `PATCH /configs/admin-console` API
    - `/configs/*` APIs are config/key-specific now. they may have different logic per key
  - cli: change valid `logto db config` keys by removing `alterationState` and adding `adminConsole` since:
    - OIDC configs and admin console configs are tenant-level configs (the concept of "tenant" can be ignored until we officially announce it)
    - alteration state is still a system-wide config

### Minor Changes

- 343b1090f: ### Add dynamic favicon and html title

  - Add the favicon field in the sign-in-experience branding settings. Users would be able to upload their own favicon. Use local logto icon as a fallback

- c12717412: ## Creating your social connector with ease

  We’re excited to announce that Logto now supports standard protocols (SAML, OIDC, and OAuth2.0) for creating social connectors to integrate external identity providers. Each protocol can create multiple social connectors, giving you more control over your access needs.

  To simplify the process of configuring social connectors, we’re replacing code-edit with simple forms. SAML already supports form configuration, with other connectors coming soon. This means you don’t need to compare documents or worry about code format.

- 343b1090f: - Automatically create a new tenant for new cloud users
  - Support path-based multi-tenancy
- 343b1090f: Allow admin tenant admin to create tenants without limitation
- 343b1090f: ### Add privacy policy url

  In addition to the terms of service url, we also provide a privacy policy url field in the sign-in-experience settings. To better support the end-users' privacy declaration needs.

- 343b1090f: New feature: User account settings page

  - We have removed the previous settings page and moved it to the account settings page. You can access to the new settings menu by clicking the user avatar in the top right corner.
  - You can directly change the language or theme from the popover menu, and explore more account settings by clicking the "Profile" menu item.
  - You can update your avatar, name and username in the profile page, and also changing your password.
  - [Cloud] Cloud users can also link their email address and social accounts (Google and GitHub at first launch).

- 343b1090f: remove the branding style config and make the logo URL config optional
- 343b1090f: Add custom CSS code editor so that users can apply advanced UI customization.
  - Users can check the real time preview of the CSS via SIE preview on the right side.
- 2168936b9: **Sign-in Experience v2**

  We are thrilled to announce the release of the newest version of the Sign-in Experience, which includes more ways to sign-in and sign-up, as well as a framework that is easier to understand and more flexible to configure in the Admin Console.

  When compared to Sign-in Experience v1, this version’s capability was expanded so that it could support a greater variety of flexible use cases. For example, now users can sign up with email verification code and sign in with email and password.

  We hope that this will be able to assist developers in delivering a successful sign-in flow, which will also be appreciated by the end users.

- f41fd3f05: Replace the `sms` naming convention using `phone` cross logto codebase. Including Sign-in Experience types, API paths, API payload and internal variable names.
